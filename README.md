# vaniDB
This project attempts to create a database of the contents of "BHAGAVATA PURANA", one of the 18 Maha Puranas; "BHAGAVAD GITA" and "CHAITANYA CARITAMRITA".
The text for this project is collected from the Vanipedia Project that is available on the Internet for everyone to benefit from.

The idea is to parse the contents of the above mentioned scriptures into the JSON format which can then be used for specific purposes including API consumption to cater to specific needs.
