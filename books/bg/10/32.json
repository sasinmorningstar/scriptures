These are all representatives of Kṛṣṇa. Among logicians there are different stages of argument. The presentation of evidence is called japa. The attempt to defeat one another is called vitaṇḍa, and the final conclusion is called vāda. The conclusive truth, the end of all reasoning processes, is Kṛṣṇa."
