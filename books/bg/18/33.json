One who is steadily fixed in the Supreme Soul with determination, concentrating one's mind, life and sensual activities on the Supreme, engages in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That sort of determination is in the mode of goodness. The word avyabhicāriṇya is very significant, for it refers to persons who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and are never deviated by any other activity."
