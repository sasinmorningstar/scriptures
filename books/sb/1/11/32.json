    "synonyms": "tam—Him (the Lord); ātma-jaiḥ—by the sons; dṛṣṭibhiḥ—by the sight; antara-ātmanā—by the innermost part of the heart; duranta-bhāvāḥ—insuperable ecstasy; parirebhire—embraced; patim—husband; niruddham—choked up; api—in spite of; āsravat—tears; ambu—like drops of water; netrayoḥ—from the eyes; vilajjatīnām—of those situated in shyness; bhṛgu-varya—O chief of the Bhṛgus; vaiklavāt—inadvertently.",
    "translation": "The insuperable ecstasy was so strong that the queens, who were shy, first embraced the Lord in the innermost recesses of their hearts. Then they embraced Him visually, and then they sent their sons to embrace Him [which is equal to personal embracing]. But, O chief amongst the Bhṛgus, though they tried to restrain their feelings, they inadvertently shed tears.",

Still, the act remained unfinished, and tears rolled down their cheeks despite all endeavors to check them. One indirectly embraces the husband by sending the son to embrace him because the son is developed as part of the mother's body. The embrace of the son is not exactly the embrace of husband and wife from the sexual point of view, but the embrace is satisfaction from the affectionate point of view. The embrace of the eyes is more effective in the conjugal relation, and thus according to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī there is nothing wrong in such an exchange of feeling between husband and wife."
