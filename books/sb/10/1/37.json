Vasudeva stressed that Devakī was not only a woman but a member of Kaṁsa s family. Because she was now married to Vasudeva, she was para-strī, another man's wife, and if such a woman were killed, not only would Kaṁsa be implicated in sinful activities, but his reputation as king of the Bhoja dynasty would be damaged. Thus Vasudeva tried in many ways to convince Kaṁsa in order to stop him from killing Devakī."
