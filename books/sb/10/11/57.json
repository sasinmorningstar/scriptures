Because of intense affection, Nanda Mahārāja could not understand Kṛṣṇa as He is. Garga Muni was able to know everything, past, present and future, by studying the Vedas, but Nanda Mahārāja could not understand Kṛṣṇa directly. Because of his intense love for Kṛṣṇa, he forgot who Kṛṣṇa was and could not understand Kṛṣṇa's potency. Although Kṛṣṇa is Nārāyaṇa Himself, Garga Muni did not disclose this. Thus Nanda Mahārāja appreciated the words of Garga Muni, but because of his deep affection he could not understand who Kṛṣṇa was, although Garga Muni had said that Kṛṣṇa's qualities would be exactly like those of Nārāyaṇa."
