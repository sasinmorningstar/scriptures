    "translation": "\nThe gopīs would say, \"If You dance, my dear Kṛṣṇa, then I shall give You half a sweetmeat.\" By saying these words or by clapping their hands, all the gopīs encouraged Kṛṣṇa in different ways. At such times, although He was the supremely powerful Personality of Godhead, He would smile and dance according to their desire, as if He were a wooden doll in their hands. Sometimes He would sing very loudly, at their bidding. In this way, Kṛṣṇa came completely under the control of the gopīs.\n\n",
