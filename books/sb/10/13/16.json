    "translation": "Thereafter, when Kṛṣṇa was unable to find the calves, He returned to the bank of the river, but there He was also unable to see the cowherd boys. Thus He began to search for both the calves and the boys, as if He could not understand what had happened.",

This was all a dramatic performance. A player knows everything, but still he plays on the stage in such a way that others do not understand him."
