Otherwise, how could this wonderful change take place? \"This māyā might be some rākṣasī-māyā,\" He thought, \"but how can rākṣasī-māyā have any influence upon Me? This is not possible. Therefore it must be the māyā of Kṛṣṇa.\" He thus concluded that the mystical change must have been caused by Kṛṣṇa, whom Balarāma considered His worshipable Personality of Godhead. He thought, \"It was arranged by Kṛṣṇa, and even I could not check its mystic power.\" Thus Balarāma understood that all these boys and calves were only expansions of Kṛṣṇa."
