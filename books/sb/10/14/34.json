Being realistic, Lord Brahmā does not aspire to directly achieve the dust of Lord Kṛṣṇa's feet; rather, he aspires for the mercy of the Lord's devotees. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that Brahmā is willing to take birth even as a stone in a paved footpath in the Lord's abode. Since Brahmā is the creator of the entire universe, we can just imagine the glorious position of the residents of Vṛndāvana.\n"

One cannot achieve such spiritual opulence by any puffed-up material process of personal improvement.

Even that would be a great fortune for me. I am just aspiring for a birth in which I will be smeared by the dust of the devotees' feet.\"\n"
