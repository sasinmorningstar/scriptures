Many devotees seriously engaged in propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness are often so busy that they cannot chant and hear the pastimes of the Lord to their full satisfaction. However, simply by their intense desire to always chant and hear about Lord Kṛṣṇa, they will achieve spiritual perfection. Of course, as far as possible one should actually vibrate these transcendental pastimes of the Lord.\n"
