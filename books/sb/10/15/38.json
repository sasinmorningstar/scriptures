Thus the whole scene was very beautiful. The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His various forms, such as Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, is always transcendental, and when He enacts His transcendental pastimes the result is always beautiful and transcendental, even when the Lord performs violent acts like killing the stubborn ass demons.\n"
