The words yathā-kāmaṁ yathā-kālam indicate that although Yaśodā and Rohiṇī satisfied all the desires of their sons, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, they also properly regulated the boys' activities. In other words, they prepared wonderful food for their children, but they saw to it that the boys ate at the proper time. Similarly, their children would play at the proper time and sleep at the proper time. The word yathā-kāmam does not indicate that the mothers indiscriminately allowed the boys to do whatever They liked, but in the proper, civilized way they showered their blessings upon their children."
