Seeing all this, the residents of Vṛndāvana were overwhelmed with anguish and confusion.",

They could not understand anything about the situation, and Kṛṣṇa's cowherd boyfriends, being unconscious, were unable to tell them anything. The cows and calves were crying out for Kṛṣṇa, and thus the whole situation was overwhelming and created a state of shock and panic among the residents of Vṛndāvana."
