Dancing becomes more enjoyable and beautiful to watch when it is accompanied by expert drum-playing, singing and the chanting of prayers. The artistic atmosphere was also enhanced by the showering of a multitude of flowers upon Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who was blissfully engaged in dancing upon the hoods of the Kāliya serpent.\n"
