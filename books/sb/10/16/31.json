With their clothing, ornaments and hair scattered in disarray, they then approached the eternal Personality of Godhead.",

They had been thinking, \"If this atheist is killed by the punishment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then let him be killed. We will become widows and engage in the worship of the Supreme Lord.\" But then the ladies noticed Kāliya's facial expression and other bodily features, and they understood that Kāliya had indeed taken shelter of the Lord within his mind. Seeing that he was manifesting symptoms of humility, remorse, regret and doubt, they thought, \"Just see how fortunate we are! Our husband has now become a Vaiṣṇava. Therefore we must now endeavor to protect him.\" They felt affection for their repentant husband and severe distress because of his miserable position, and thus all together they went into the presence of the Supreme Lord."
