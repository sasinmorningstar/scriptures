The Ninth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam describes his falldown for this offense. Because of false pride, Saubhari Muni lost his power of austerity, and with it his spiritual beauty and happiness. When Garuḍa came to the Yamunā, Saubhari Muni thought, \"Although he may be a personal associate of the Supreme Lord, I will still curse him and even kill him if he disobeys my order.\" Such an offensive attitude against an exalted Vaiṣṇava will certainly destroy one's auspicious position in life.\n"
