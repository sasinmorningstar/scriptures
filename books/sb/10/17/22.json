The residents of Vṛndāvana took shelter of Kṛṣṇa, thinking, \"This blessed boy will certainly be empowered by God to save us.\" They remembered the words of the sage Garga Muni, spoken at the birth ceremony of Lord Kṛṣṇa: anena sarva-durgāṇi yūyam añjas tariṣyatha. \"By His power you will easily be able to cross over all obstacles.\" (SB 10.8.16) Therefore the residents of Vṛndāvana, who had full faith in Kṛṣṇa, took shelter of the Lord in hopes of being saved from the impending disaster threatened by the forest fire."
