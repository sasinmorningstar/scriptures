The answer is that in His original form, God has a most playful nature and occasionally enjoys submitting to the strength or desire of His loving friends. A father may sometimes playfully fall down on the ground when struck by his beloved little child. These acts of love give pleasure to all parties. Thus Śrīdāmā agreed to ride on Lord Kṛṣṇa's shoulders to please his beloved friend, who happened to be Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
