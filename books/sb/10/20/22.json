Despite all these inconveniences, ducks and cranes continue meandering around the lakeshores. Similarly, innumerable painful occurrences are always disturbing family life, but a materialistic man never even considers leaving his family in the hands of his grown sons and going away for spiritual improvement. He regards such an idea as shocking and uncivilized, because he is completely ignorant of the Absolute Truth and his relationship to that Truth."
