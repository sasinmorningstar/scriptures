He filled the holes of His flute with the nectar of His lips, and the cowherd boys sang His glories.",

Kṛṣṇa's artful way of dressing and the beautiful blue flowers placed over His ears excited the gopīs' romantic desires, and as He poured the nectar of His lips into His flute, they simply lost themselves in ecstatic love for Him."
