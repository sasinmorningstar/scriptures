Rather, they were simply joyful to have this opportunity to associate with their beloved.\n\n",

Whatever You like, You can do, because You have complete freedom to act. But in spite of all of Your dealings, You are My Lord eternally, and I have no other worshipable object.' This is the attitude of the gopīs toward Kṛṣṇa.\"\n"
