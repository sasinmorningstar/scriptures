To celebrate the successful completion of their vow, the girls invited young Rādhārāṇī—the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu and the special object of their affection—along with other important gopīs, and brought them all to the river to bathe. Their playing in the water was meant to serve as the avabhṛtha-snāna, the ceremonial bath taken immediately upon the completion of a Vedic sacrifice."

The portion of the river where the girls and women take bath was strictly prohibited to any male, and this is still the system. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing the minds of the unmarried young gopīs, awarded them their desired objective. They had prayed for Kṛṣṇa to become their husband, and Kṛṣṇa wanted to fulfill their desires.\""
