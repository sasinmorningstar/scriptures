Lord Kṛṣṇa is ātma-priya, the real object of love for everyone. Although each individual has his own taste and freedom, ultimately every living being is a spiritual spark of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; thus everyone's primary loving attraction is constitutionally meant for Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Loving service to the Lord should be ahaitukī, without personal motive, and avyavahitā, unobstructed by mental speculation, selfish desire or any quirk of time and circumstance.\n"
