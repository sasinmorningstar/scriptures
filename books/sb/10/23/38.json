Rather, the brāhmaṇas deceived themselves, as indicated by the Sanskrit word nṛ-viḍambayoḥ, which means that Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma are bewildering for an ordinary human being who considers Them also to be human. Still, because the wives of the brāhmaṇas were great devotees of the Lord, the foolish brāhmaṇas received spiritual benefit and finally came to their senses."
