The philosophy of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a primitive polytheistic doctrine holding that human beings on the earth are gods. Rather, it is a science that traces the descent of authority from the Absolute Truth Himself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. The authority and power of God naturally extend along with the extension of His creation, and on the earth the Lord's will and authority are represented by purified, enlightened men called brāhmaṇas.\n"

In fact, this pastime exposes the pretentious position of so-called brāhmaṇas who are not faithful devotees of the Supreme Lord.\n"
