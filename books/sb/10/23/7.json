The boys expected the brāhmaṇas to know the Vedic injunction annasya kṣuditaṁ pātram: \"Anyone who is hungry is a fit candidate for receiving food in charity.\" But if the brāhmaṇas would not recognize the authority of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, their title dvija would be taken to mean merely \"born from two parents\" (dvi-from two, ja-born) rather than \"twice-born.\" When the brāhmaṇas did not respond to the cowherd boys' initial request, the boys addressed the brāhmaṇas, with a slight trace of sarcasm, as dharma-vit-tamāḥ, \"O best of the knowers of religion.\""
