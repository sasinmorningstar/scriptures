Thus He gave His mercy to those brāhmaṇas as well as to their chaste wives, who had no one to associate with except their husbands. In that place the cowherd men, headed by Lord Kṛṣṇa's father, Nanda Mahārāja, were somehow or other preparing an elaborate sacrifice to Lord Indra, and Lord Kṛṣṇa reacted as follows."
