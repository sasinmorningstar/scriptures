According to this philosophy, there are subtle laws of nature that reward or punish us according to how we act: \"As you sow, so shall you reap.\" In a future life one reaps the fruit of his present work, and this is the sum and substance of reality. Lord Kṛṣṇa, being God Himself, could hardly be a serious proponent of this mediocre philosophy. In the role of a young boy He was simply teasing His pure devotees by preaching it."
