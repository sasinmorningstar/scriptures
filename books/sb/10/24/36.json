Thus, in His form as a child, Kṛṣṇa led the residents of Vṛndāvana in bowing down to His new incarnation as Govardhana Hill, and to all He pointed out the great mercy bestowed by this divine form of Govardhana. Lord Kṛṣṇa's amazing transcendental activities were certainly in keeping with the festive atmosphere."
