Kṛṣṇa's superiors offered auspicious benedictions, lovingly smelled His head, kissed Him, rubbed His arms and fingers, and inquired with parental affection as to whether He was tired or pained. Kṛṣṇa's equals laughed or joked with Him, and those who were younger fell at His feet, massaged His feet, and so on."
