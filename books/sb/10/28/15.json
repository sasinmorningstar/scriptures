This and innumerable other Vaikuṇṭha planets float in an infinite ocean of spiritual light called the brahmajyoti. That spiritual light is in fact the spiritual sky, which Kṛṣṇa also, quite naturally, revealed to the residents of Vṛndāvana. For example, if we want to show the moon to a child, we say, \"Look up in the sky. See the moon over there in the sky.\" Similarly, Lord Kṛṣṇa revealed the vast spiritual sky to the residents of Vṛndāvana, but as emphasized in Text 14 and in the following text, 16, the actual destination of the Lord's associates was His own spiritual planet.\n"
