First, the servant was foolishly ignorant of Nanda Mahārāja's position as the pastime father of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Also, Nanda Mahārāja's intention was to carry out the injunctions of scripture; therefore Varuṇa's servant should not have arrested Nanda on the technical grounds that he bathed in the Yamunā at an inauspicious time. Later in this chapter Varuṇa himself will say, ajānatā māmakena mūḍhena: \"This was done by my ignorant servant, who is a fool.\" This foolish servant did not understand the position of Kṛṣṇa or Nanda Mahārāja or devotional service to the Lord.\n"
