By Kṛṣṇa's physical contact with His girlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the kuṅkuma powder on Her breasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.' Thus the gopīs smelled the aroma of the two lovers' bodies, of Kṛṣṇa's jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover.\"\n"
