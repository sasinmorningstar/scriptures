You are eager to realize the ecstasy of seeing Kṛṣṇa, and thus your eyes are following Him. In fact, He is never lost to you.'"

Conjecturing in this way, the gopīs detect a fragrance that has by chance blown their way, and they repeatedly declare with great joy, 'Yes! Yes! This is it! By Kṛṣṇa's physical contact with His girlfriend, His jasmine garland was smeared with the kuṅkuma powder on Her breasts, and the fragrances of all these things are reaching us.' Thus the gopīs smelled the aroma of the two lovers' bodies, of Kṛṣṇa's jasmine garland, and of the cosmetic powder on the breasts of His lover.\""
