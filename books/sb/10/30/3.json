    "synonyms": "gati—in His movements; smita—smiling; prekṣaṇa—beholding; bhāṣaṇā—talking; ādiṣu—and so on; priyāḥ—the dear gopīs; priyasya—of their beloved; pratirūḍha—fully absorbed; mūrtayaḥ—their bodies; asau—He; aham—I; tu—actually; iti—speaking thus; abalāḥ—the women; nyavediṣuḥ—they announced; kṛṣṇa-vihāra—caused by the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa; vibhramāḥ—whose intoxication.",
    "translation": "Because the beloved gopīs were absorbed in thoughts of their beloved Kṛṣṇa, their bodies imitated His way of moving and smiling, His way of beholding them, His speech and His other distinctive features. Deeply immersed in thinking of Him and maddened by remembering His pastimes, they declared to one another, \"I am Kṛṣṇa!\"",

The gopīs were completely absorbed in the existence of Kṛṣṇa and mad with love at their sudden separation from Him, and thus their dedication to Him attained absolute perfection."
