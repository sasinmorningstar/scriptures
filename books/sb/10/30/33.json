Therefore They sat down together facing the same direction, with Rādhārāṇī between Kṛṣṇa's knees, and Kṛṣṇa proceeded to arrange Her hair with flowers and make a flower crown for Her, coronating Her as the goddess of the forest. Thus the romantic young boy and girl played and joked together in Vṛndāvana."
