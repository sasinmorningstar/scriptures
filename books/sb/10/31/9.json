            "content": "King Pratāparudra recited this verse to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu during Lord Jagannātha's Ratha-yātrā festival. While the Lord was resting in a garden, King Pratāparudra humbly entered and began massaging His legs and lotus feet. Then the King recited the Thirty-first Chapter of the Tenth Canto of the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the songs of the gopīs. The Caitanya-caritāmṛta relates that when Lord Caitanya heard this verse, beginning tava kathāmṛtam, He immediately arose in ecstatic love and embraced King Pratāparudra. The incident is described in detail in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya 14.4-18), and in his edition Śrīla Prabhupāda has given extensive commentary on it."
