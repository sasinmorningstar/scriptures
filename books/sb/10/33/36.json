Thus here it is stated, mānuṣaṁ deham āsthitaḥ: \"He assumes a humanlike body.\" Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura glorifies the Lord's conjugal pastimes, stating that these romantic affairs have an inconceivable spiritual potency to attract the polluted heart of conditioned souls. It is an undeniable fact that any pure—or simple—hearted person who hears narrations of the loving affairs of Kṛṣṇa will be attracted to the lotus feet of the Lord and gradually become His devotee ."
