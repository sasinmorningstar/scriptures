    "translation": "\nAs Kṛṣṇa strolls through Vraja with His lotus-petal-like feet, marking the ground with the distinctive emblems of flag, thunderbolt, lotus and elephant goad, He relieves the distress the ground feels from the cows' hooves. As He plays His renowned flute, His body moves with the grace of an elephant. Thus we gopīs, who become agitated by Cupid when Kṛṣṇa playfully glances at us, stand as still as trees, unaware that our hair and garments are slackening.\n\n",

It is clear from the comments of Jīva Gosvāmī and other ācāryas that the statements in this chapter were made at various times and places. This is natural, since the gopīs were always absorbed in thoughts of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, day and night.\n"
