But on the spiritual platform, so-called pain is simply a different variety of spiritual ecstasy. In the Western countries, people take pleasure in mixing different flavors of ice cream to produce wonderful combinations of flavor. Similarly, on the spiritual platform Śrī Kṛṣṇa and His devotees expertly mix the flavors of spiritual bliss, and thus every day was a treat for the gopīs.\n"
