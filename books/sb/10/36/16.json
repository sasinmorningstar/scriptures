Deva means \"God,\" and darśanaḥ means \"seeing\" or \"an audience with a great personality.\" Thus deva-darśana, a name for Nārada Muni, indicates that Nārada has attained the perfection of seeing God, that getting Nārada's audience is as good as getting God's (since Nārada is a pure representative of the Lord), and also that Nārada's audience is as good as that of the demigods, who are also known as devas.
