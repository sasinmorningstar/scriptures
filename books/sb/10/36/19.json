According to the ācāryas, Nārada also advised Kaṁsa that if he killed Vasudeva the two young boys might flee and that it was therefore better not to kill him. Rather, Nārada recommended, Kaṁsa should bring Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma to Kaṁsa's capital city, Mathurā."

In fact, as explained in the Eleventh Canto, Vasudeva was grateful to Nārada because he was arranging for Kaṁsa's death at Kṛṣṇa's hands, and further arranging for Kṛṣṇa to come and live in Mathurā, where His loving father could associate with Him."
