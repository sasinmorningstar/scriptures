    "translation": "Encircling the Lord and worshiping Him were Nanda, Sunanda and His other personal attendants; Sanaka and the other Kumāras; Brahmā, Rudra and other chief demigods; the nine chief brāhmaṇas; and the best of the saintly devotees, headed by Prahlāda, Nārada and Uparicara Vasu. Each of these great personalities was worshiping the Lord by chanting sanctified words of praise in his own unique mood. Also in attendance were the Lord's principal internal potencies—Śrī, Puṣṭi, Gīr, Kānti, Kīrti, Tuṣṭi, Ilā and Ūrjā—as were His material potencies Vidyā, Avidyā and Māyā, and His internal pleasure potency, Śakti.",

These are the Lord's six opulences. Ilā is His bhū-śakti, also known as sandhinī, the internal potency of whom the element earth is an expansion. Ūrjā is His internal potency for performing pastimes; she expands as the tulasī plant in this world. Vidyā and Avidyā [knowledge and ignorance] are external potencies who cause the living entities' liberation and bondage, respectively. Śakti is His internal pleasure potency, hlādinī, and Māyā is an internal potency who is the basis of Vidyā and Avidyā. The word ca implies the presence of the Lord's marginal energy, the jīva-śakti, who is subordinate to Māyā. Lord Viṣṇu was being served by all these personified potencies.\""
