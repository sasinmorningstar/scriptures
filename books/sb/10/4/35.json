Kaṁsa's ministers reminded Kaṁsa that despite his power, he was cognizant of the principles of fighting, and therefore he had excused the demigods because of their incapability. \"But the present emergency,\" the ministers said, \"is not intended for such mercy or military etiquette. Now you should prepare to fight under any circumstances.\" Thus they advised Kaṁsa to give up the traditional etiquette in fighting and chastise the enemy at any cost."
