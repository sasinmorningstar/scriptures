Yet even though you have come to Mathurā from your cowherd village, you have not come to visit me. Is that because you are frightened? Don't think that your two sons are bad because They broke the bow. I invited Them here because I heard They were extremely powerful, and I've arranged this wrestling match as a test of Their strength. So please come forward without hesitation. Don't be afraid.\""
