The Lords reasoned: 'Even after We have made Our power known by breaking the bow and by performing other feats, Our parents have still not secured freedom. Kaṁsa is again trying to kill them. Therefore, although he is Our maternal uncle, it will not be wrong for Us to kill him.' They assured Their offenselessness by this reasoning.\""
