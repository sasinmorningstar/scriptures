Rather, the Lord wanted to enjoy with them the ecstatic love of vātsalya-rasa, the relationship between parents and children. As Śrīla Prabhupāda often pointed out, although we normally think of God as the supreme father, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness we can enter into the Lord's pastimes and play the part of His parents, thus intensifying our love for Him."

He further explains that jana may also be translated as \"parents,\" since jana is derived from the verb jan, which in the causative form (janayate) means \"to generate or to give birth to.\" In this sense of the word (as in jananī or janakau), the term jana-mohinī indicates that the Lord was about to expand His internal illusory potency so that Vasudeva and Devakī would again love Him as their dear child."
