'Like a covered flame, Lord Kṛṣṇa remained there incognito with Balarāma for eleven years' (SB 3.2.26) And since Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma never took brahminical initiation in Vraja-bhūmi, it was at the time (of Their going to Mathurā) that Their kaiśora stage began rather than ended.\n"

And the period from the age of six years and eight months through His tenth year, during which time He lived in Nandīśvara [Nandagrāma], constitutes His kaiśora stage. Then, at the age of ten years and seven months, on the eleventh lunar day of the dark fortnight of the month of Caitra, He went to Mathurā, and on the fourteenth day thereafter He killed Kaṁsa.
