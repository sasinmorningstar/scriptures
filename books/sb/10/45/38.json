They sometimes say that primitive men think that the ocean is a god or that the sun and moon are gods. In fact, references such as the word sindhu in this verse, meaning \"the ocean,\" indicate the person who governs that aspect of physical nature."

In the United Nations we may say, \"The United States votes 'Yes,' the Soviet Union votes 'No.' \" We hardly mean that the physical countries or the buildings in them have voted. We mean that a particular person, representing that political and geographical entity, has voted. Yet the newspapers will simply say, \"The United States voted, decided, etc.\" and everyone knows what that means."

However, much in modern scholarship must be rethought in the light of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
