            "content": "The word vilakṣaṇa means either \"distinctly perceiving\" or \"confused,\" depending on how the prefix vi—is understood in context. In the case of enlightened souls, vilakṣaṇa means \"perceiving the correct distinction between the body and the soul\" and thus Lord Kṛṣṇa, as indicated by the word īśāte, guides the spiritually advancing soul. The other meaning of vilakṣaṇa—\"confused\" or \"bewildered\"—clearly applies to those who have not understood the difference between the soul and the body, or the distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme Soul. Such bewildered living beings do not go back home, back to Godhead, to the eternal spiritual world, but rather achieve temporary destinations according to the laws of nature."
