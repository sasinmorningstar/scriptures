    "translation": "\nThe minds of those gopīs are always absorbed in Me, and their very lives are ever devoted to Me. For My sake they have abandoned everything related to their bodies, renouncing ordinary happiness in this life, as well as religious duties necessary for such happiness in the next life. I alone am their dearmost beloved and, indeed, their very Self. I personally sustain such devotees, who for My sake give up all worldly duties.\n\n",

According to the Vaiṣṇava ācāryas, the word daihikāḥ, \"related to the body,\" refers to husbands, children, homes and so on. The gopīs loved Kṛṣṇa so intensely that they could think of nothing else. Since Śrī Kṛṣṇa maintains ordinary devotees engaged in sādhana-bhakti, devotional service in practice, He will certainly maintain the gopīs, His most exalted devotees.\n"
