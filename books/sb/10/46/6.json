Rather, their husbands merely presumed, \"These are our wives.\" In other words, by Lord Kṛṣṇa's spiritual potency, the gopīs existed entirely for His pleasure, and Kṛṣṇa loved them in the mood of a paramour. In fact, the gopīs were manifestations of Kṛṣṇa's internal nature, His supreme pleasure potency, and on the spiritual platform they attracted the Lord by their pure love."
