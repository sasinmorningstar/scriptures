            "content": "This text gives an interesting insight into the Lord's pastimes. The first line says, atha vijñnāya bhagavān: \"Thus the Lord, understanding [Uddhava's report]....\" The second line states that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Soul of everything (sarvātmā) and the seer of everything (sarva-darśanaḥ). In other words, although He certainly does not depend on spoken reports from messengers, He plays the part of a human being and listens to news from a messenger—not out of need, as we would do, but in the bliss of His spiritual pastimes, exchanging love with His pure devotee. The word sarva-darśanaḥ also indicates that the Lord perfectly understood the feelings of the residents of Vraja and was perfectly reciprocating with them within their hearts. Now, in His external pastimes, He desired to bless Śrīmatī Trivakrā, who was about to be freed from the disease of material lust."
