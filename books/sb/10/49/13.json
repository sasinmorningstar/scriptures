As conscious souls, we have a connection with the Supreme Soul through bhakti, or devotion. Through that relationship we experience perfect knowledge of the Supreme Soul. Since the Supreme Soul is the Absolute Truth, perfect knowledge of Him means perfect knowledge of everything. As stated in the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (1.3), yasmin vijñāte sarvam evam vijñātaṁ bhavati: When the Absolute is understood, everything is understood. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, by His spiritual potency, establishes our connection with Him, and that connection is the source of all spiritual knowledge. Thus Ācārya Śrīdhara, by his thoughtful translation, stimulates us to deeper understanding of Kṛṣṇa conscious philosophy."
