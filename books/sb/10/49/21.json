Bhuṅkte means \"(the living being) experiences,\" and anu means \"following,\" or \"in sequence.\" In other words, we experience happiness and distress according to the moral and spiritual quality of our activities. We are responsible for what we do. Dhṛtarāṣṭra was falsely and obsessively attached to his evil-minded sons, forgetting that he alone would have to suffer for his imprudent behavior."
