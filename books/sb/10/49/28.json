In fact, events have been set in motion by his attachment and sinful propensities, and therefore he should have taken responsibility for his own acts. Lord Kṛṣṇa clearly states in the Bhagavad-gītā (BG 5.15), nādatte kasyacit pāpam: \"The Supreme Lord does not accept responsibility for anyone's sinful activities.\" It is a dangerous policy to claim that we are acting improperly because of \"destiny\" or \"fate.\" We should take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously and create an auspicious future for ourselves and our associates.\n"

In answer to this we may say that the Lord's pastimes are not only entertaining but also didactic, and the lesson here is that Dhṛtarāṣṭra should have acted properly. This is what the Lord wanted to teach. Dhṛtarāṣṭra claims that Kṛṣṇa came to relieve the burden of the earth, but the earth's burden is precisely the improper behavior of its inhabitants. So, let us take the lesson the Lord wants to teach here and be instructed for our benefit.\n"
