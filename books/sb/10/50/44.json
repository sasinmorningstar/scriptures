Infuriated by their laughter, Gārgya set out for the south, thinking, 'May I have a son who will bring terror to the Yādavas.' He worshiped Lord Mahādeva, eating powdered iron, and after twelve years obtained his desired benediction. Elated, he returned home.\n"

Thus sent by Nārada, Kālayavana appeared at Mathurā.\"\n"
