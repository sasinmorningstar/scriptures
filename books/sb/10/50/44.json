Infuriated by their laughter, Gārgya set out for the south, thinking, 'May I have a son who will bring terror to the Yādavas.' He worshiped Lord Mahādeva, eating powdered iron, and after twelve years obtained his desired benediction. Elated, he returned home."

Kālayavana possessed the fury of Lord Śiva in his aspect as Mahākāla. Once, Kālayavana asked Nārada, 'Who are now the strongest kings on earth?' Nārada replied that the Yadus were. Thus sent by Nārada, Kālayavana appeared at Mathurā.\""
