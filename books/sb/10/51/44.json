All of this is taking place within the context of kṛṣṇa-līlā, the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa. It is well known to Vaiṣṇavas that the four-handed forms of Viṣṇu, or Nārāyaṇa, are expansions of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Thus within the pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa there may also appear viṣṇu-līlā, the activities of Viṣṇu. Such are the qualities and activities of the Supreme Godhead. Deeds that for us would be extraordinary and even impossible are commonplace, effortless pastimes for the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

According to Ācārya Viśvanātha, Garga Muni further informed Mucukunda that he would personally see the Lord. Now it was all happening."
