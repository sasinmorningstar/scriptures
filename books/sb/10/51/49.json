Those who are trying to exploit the material world are pramatta: \"deluded, bewildered, maddened by desire.\" But the Lord is apramatta: \"alert, sober, and unbewildered.\" In our madness we may deny God or His laws, but the Lord is sober and will not fail to reward or punish us according to the quality of our activities."
