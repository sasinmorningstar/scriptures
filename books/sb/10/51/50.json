And if one is so blessed as to be buried in a coffin, one's body may very well be consumed by worms and other minuscule creatures. Also, many earthly cadavers are burned and thus transformed into ashes. In any case, death is certain, and the ultimate fate of the body is never sublime. That is the real purport of Mucukunda's statement here—that the body, though now called \"king,\" \"prince,\" \"beauty queen,\" \"upper-middle class\" and so on, will eventually be called \"stool,\" \"worms\" and \"ashes.\""
