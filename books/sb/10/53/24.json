When Rukmiṇī did not see Him come, she naturally feared that He had rejected her proposal, perhaps finding some unacceptable quality in her. As expressed here, the Lord Himself is anavadya, faultless, and if He saw some fault in Rukmiṇī she would be an unworthy bride for Him. It was natural for the young princess to feel such anxiety. Furthermore, if Śrī Kṛṣṇa had actually made this decision, it would be natural for the brāhmaṇa to fear Rukmiṇī's reaction were he to bring her the news, and that would explain why he had not come."
