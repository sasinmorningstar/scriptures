Because of our attraction and repulsion for our own body and other bodies, we establish temporary relationships, dedicate ourselves to great endeavors and sacrifices, concoct imaginary religions, make noble speeches and thoroughly involve ourselves in material illusion. As Shakespeare said, \"All the world's a stage.\" Beyond the somewhat absurd theater of material existence is the real and meaningful world of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the liberated life of pure souls devoted in loving service to the Supreme Lord.\n"
