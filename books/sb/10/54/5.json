The Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, desires to share His blissful opulences with all living beings, and thus He sincerely invites them to come back home, back to Godhead. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, introduced throughout the world by Śrīla Prabhupāda on the order of his spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, who himself preached all over India on the order of his exalted father, Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, is broadcasting the loving message of Lord Kṛṣṇa: Remember Him, serve Him, return to Him and share in the infinite bounty of the kingdom of God."
