Śambara, having also come to Śiva for a benediction, was recognized by the lord first, who told him, \"You should now ask for your benediction.\" Śambara, struck with lust at seeing Rati, replied that he wanted her as his benediction, and Śiva complied. Lord Śiva then consoled the sobbing Rati, telling her, \"Go with him, and in his very home you will attain what you desire.\" Thereupon, Rati bewildered Śambara with her deluding power and, taking the name Māyāvatī, remained in his house untouched."
