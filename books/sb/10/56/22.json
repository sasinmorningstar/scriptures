So-called Vedic scholars, including most Western ones, enjoy translating the word puruṣam as \"man\" even when the word refers to Lord Kṛṣṇa, and thus their unauthorized translations of Vedic literature are tainted by their materialistic conceptions of the Godhead. However, here it is clearly stated that it was because Jāmbavān misunderstood the Lord's position that he considered Him prākṛta-puruṣa, \"a mundane person.\" In other words, the Lord is actually puruṣottama, \"the ultimate transcendental person.\""
