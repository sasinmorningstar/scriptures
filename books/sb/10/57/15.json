As explained in many Vedic literatures, the one Supreme Lord expands Himself into innumerable forms, yet He remains the one and almighty God. For example, we have this statement in the Brahma-saṁhitā (BS 5.38): advaitam acyutam anādir ananta-rūpam. \"The one Supreme Lord is infallible and beginningless, and He expands Himself into innumerable manifest forms.\" Out of regard for the spirit of the Lord's pastimes, in which He expands Himself and appears as His own older brother, Balarāma, the Bhāgavatam here refers to \"the two Lords.\" But the \"bottom line\" is that there is one Supreme Godhead, one Absolute Truth, who appears in His original form as Kṛṣṇa."
