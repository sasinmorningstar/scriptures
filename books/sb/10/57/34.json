Superficially these evils may have been caused by Akrūra's absence, and also by the absence of the auspicious Syamantaka jewel. But we should recall that Dvārakā is the eternal abode of Lord Kṛṣṇa; it is a city of divine bliss because the Lord resides there. Still, to execute His pastimes as a prince of this world, Lord Kṛṣṇa did the needful and summoned Akrūra."
