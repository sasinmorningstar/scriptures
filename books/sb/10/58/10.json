In other words, the Lord doesn't play favorites. As He says in the Bhagavad-gītā (BG 9.29), samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu: \"I am equal to everyone.\" So while the Lord reciprocates with all souls, it is natural that those who love Him intensely receive His special attention, for they want Him and nothing else.\n"
