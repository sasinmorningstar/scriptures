She insists that she will not accept any husband except Lord Kṛṣṇa, and she states that He is the shelter for those who have no other master. Since she will accept no other shelter, Kṛṣṇa must give her shelter. Also, she says, tuṣyatāṁ me sa bhagavān: \"May that Supreme Lord be pleased with me.\" This is her prayer."
