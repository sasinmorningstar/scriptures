From this incident we can appreciate the beautiful spiritual processes executed in previous ages by great souls. Unlike the so-called love in worldly \"love affairs,\" beautiful Kālindī's love for Lord Kṛṣṇa was pure and perfect. Even though Kālindī was a tender young girl, her determination to marry Kṛṣṇa was so strong that she arranged for her father to build her a house in the Yamunā where she could perform severe austerities until the day her beloved came.\n"
