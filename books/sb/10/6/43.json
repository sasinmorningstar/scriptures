    "translation": "O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, best of the Kurus, Nanda Mahārāja was very liberal and simple. He immediately took his son Kṛṣṇa on his lap as if Kṛṣṇa had returned from death, and by formally smelling his son's head, Nanda Mahārāja undoubtedly enjoyed transcendental bliss.",

He did not understand that Kṛṣṇa had wanted to kill Pūtanā and that His pastimes were performed by yogamāyā. Nanda Mahārāja simply thought that someone had entered his house and created havoc. This was Nanda Mahārāja's simplicity."
