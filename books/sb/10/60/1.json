In other words, the lovely, chaste qualities of Rukmiṇī will become manifest as a result of Lord Kṛṣṇa's apparently insensitive words, just as camphor's fragrance becomes manifest when granules of camphor are crushed by a grinding stone. The ācārya further points out that Rukmiṇī is personally serving the Lord because He is jagad-gurum, the spiritual master of the universe, and patim, her husband.\n"
