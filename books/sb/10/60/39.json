    "translation": "Knowing that great sages who have renounced the sannyāsī's daṇḍa proclaim Your glories, that You are the Supreme Soul of all the worlds, and that You are so gracious that You give away even Your own self, I chose You as my husband, rejecting Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and the rulers of heaven, whose aspirations are all frustrated by the force of time, which is born from Your eyebrows. What interest, then, could I have in any other suitors?",

There the Lord Kṛṣṇa said, bhikṣubhiḥ ślāghitā mudhā: \"I am glorified by beggars.\" But Queen Rukmiṇī points out that those so-called beggars are actually sages in the paramahaṁsa stage of life—sannyāsīs who have reached the highest level of spiritual advancement and thus given up the sannyāsī rod. Lord Kṛṣṇa also made two specific accusations against His wife in Text 16. He said, vaidarbhy etad avijñāya—\"My dear Vaidarbhī, you were not aware of the situation\"—and tvayādīrgha-samīkṣayā—\"because you lack foresight.\" In the present verse, Rukmiṇī's statement iti me vṛto 'si indicates \"I chose You as my husband because You possess the above-mentioned qualities. It was not a blind choice at all.\" Rukmiṇī further mentions that she passed over lesser personalities like Brahmā, Śiva and the rulers of heaven because she saw that even though, materially speaking, they are great personalities, they are frustrated by the powerful waves of time, which emanate from the eyebrows of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, far from lacking foresight, Rukmiṇī chose Lord Kṛṣṇa after an exhaustive appraisal of the entire cosmic situation. Thus she lovingly rebukes her husband here."
