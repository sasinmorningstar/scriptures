That is, Text 5 of this chapter is almost identical with Text 44 of the fifty-ninth chapter in this canto, and Text 6 is identical with Text 45 of that chapter. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains that the term varārhaṇa (\"excellent offerings\") indicates that the queens offered the Lord palmfuls of flowers (puṣpāñjali) and palmfuls of jewels (ratnāñjali)."
