Thus the Śiva-jvara addresses Kṛṣṇa as ananta-śakti, \"possessor of unlimited potency\"; pareśa, \"the supreme controller\"; and sarvātmā, \"the Supersoul of all beings —even of Lord Śiva."

According to our limited understanding, we act in this world, but Lord Kṛṣṇa, with His unlimited understanding, performs infinite works of creation, maintenance and annihilation. As Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out, even the functions of the gross elements, such as air, depend on Him. The Taittirīya Upaniṣad (2.8.1) confirms this: bhīṣāsmād vātaḥ-pavate. \"Out of fear of Him, the wind blows.\" Thus Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate object of worship for all living beings."
