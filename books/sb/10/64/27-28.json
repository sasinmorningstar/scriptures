            "content": "Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī comments as follows on this verse: His faith emboldened upon receiving the Lord's mercy and thus attaining the status of servitude, King Nṛga properly glorifies the Lord by chanting His names and then asks the Lord's permission to take his leave. The spirit of his prayer is as follows: \"You are Devadeva, God even of the gods, and Jagannātha, the master of the universe, so please be my master. O Govinda, please make me Your property with the same merciful glance You use to enchant the cows. You can do this because You are Puruṣottama, the supreme form of Godhead. O Nārāyaṇa, since You are the foundation of the living entities, please be my support, even though I am a bad living entity. O Hṛṣīkeśa, please make my senses Your own. O Puṇyaśloka, now You have become famous as the deliverer of Nṛga. O Acyuta, please never be lost to my mind. O Avyaya, You will never diminish in my mind.\" Thus the great Bhāgavatam commentator Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī explains the purport of these verses."
