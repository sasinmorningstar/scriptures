This is the difference between Him and them. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds the following commentary: \"Considering themselves different from other women, the gopīs thought as follows: 'If other women are together with their lovers, they live, and if they are separated, they die. But we neither live nor die. This is the fate Providence has written on our foreheads. What remedy can we find?\" '"
