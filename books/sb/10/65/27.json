Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī calls her a \"shadow\" of Kālindī, and Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī confirms that she is an expansion of Kālindī, not Kālindī herself. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī also gives evidence from Śrī Hari-vaṁśa—in the statement pratyuvācārṇava-vadhūm—that Goddess Yamunā is the wife of the ocean. The Hari-vaṁśa therefore also refers to her as sāgarāṅganā."
