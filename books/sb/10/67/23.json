Lord Balarāma, in a great sporting mood, began to smash those big pieces of stone into mere pebbles.\" Even today there are many sports wherein people enjoy striking a ball or similar object with a stick or bat. This sporting propensity exists originally in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who playfully (līlayā) pulverized the deadly boulders hurled at Him by the powerful Dvivida."
