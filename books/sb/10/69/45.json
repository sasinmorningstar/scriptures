            "content": "Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī has given various meanings for the word ananya-viṣayāṇi. This term may indicate that the Lord performed activities in Dvārakā that were unusual even for His plenary expansions, to say nothing of others. Or the term can be understood to indicate that the Lord performed these activities for the sake of His pure, exclusive devotees. In any case, one who recites or hears accounts of these pastimes will certainly be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and, as Śrīla Prabhupāda writes, \"certainly find it very easy to traverse the path of liberation and taste the nectar of the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa.\" Śrīla Prabhupāda further points out that the word anumodate here indicates that one who \"supports a preacher of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement\" will also receive the benefits mentioned here."
