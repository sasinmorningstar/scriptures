    "synonyms": "ruditam—mother Yaśodā, crying pitifully; anuniśamya—after hearing; tatra—there; gopyaḥ—the other ladies, the gopīs; bhṛśam—highly; anutapta—lamenting sympathetically after mother Yaśodā; dhiyaḥ—with such feelings; aśru-pūrṇa-mukhyaḥ—and the other gopīs, their faces full of tears; ruruduḥ—they were crying; anupalabhya—without finding; nanda-sūnum—the son of Nanda Mahārāja, Kṛṣṇa; pavane—when the whirlwind; upārata—had ceased; pāṁśu-varṣa-vege—its force of showering dust.",
    "translation": "When the force of the dust storm and the winds subsided, Yaśodā's friends, the other gopīs, approached mother Yaśodā, hearing her pitiful crying. Not seeing Kṛṣṇa present, they too felt very much aggrieved and joined mother Yaśodā in crying, their eyes full of tears.",

            "content": "This attachment of the gopīs to Kṛṣṇa is wonderful and transcendental. The center of all the activities of the gopīs was Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa was there they were happy, and when Kṛṣṇa was not there, they were unhappy. Thus when mother Yaśodā was lamenting Kṛṣṇa's absence, the other ladies also began to cry."
