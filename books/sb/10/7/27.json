    "synonyms": "tam—Kṛṣṇa; aśmānam—very heavy stone like a lump of iron; manyamānaḥ—thinking like that; ātmanaḥ guru-mattayā—because of being heavier than he could personally perceive; gale—his neck; gṛhīte—being embraced or encircled by His arms; utsraṣṭum—to give up; na aśaknot—was not able; adbhuta-arbhakam—this wonderful child who was different from an ordinary child.",
    "translation": "Because of Kṛṣṇa's weight, Tṛṇāvarta considered Him to be like a great mountain or a hunk of iron. But because Kṛṣṇa had caught the demon's neck, the demon was unable to throw Him off. He therefore thought of the child as wonderful, since he could neither bear the child nor cast aside the burden.",

Thus Tṛṇāvarta's attempt to kill Kṛṣṇa failed, while Kṛṣṇa, ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-vigraha, enjoyed this pastime. Now, since Tṛṇāvarta was falling because of Kṛṣṇa's heaviness, he wanted to save himself by throwing Kṛṣṇa off from his neck, but was unable to do so because Kṛṣṇa held him very tightly. Consequently, this would be the last time for Tṛṇāvarta's yogic power. Now he was going to die by the arrangement of Kṛṣṇa."
