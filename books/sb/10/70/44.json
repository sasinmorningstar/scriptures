Śrīdhara Svāmī mentions that the word dig-vitānam indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa's transcendental glories spread throughout the universe like a cooling canopy over the universal directions. In other words, the whole world can find shelter under the cooling shade of the Lord's lotus feet. Thus the Lord is bhuvana-maṅgala, the symbol of everything auspicious for this world."
