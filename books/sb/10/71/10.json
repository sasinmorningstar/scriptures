The great commentator Śrīdhara Svāmī further explains that the term pāka indicates that the kings will be saved as a result of their piety, and that the term vipākena indicates that Jarāsandha will die as a result of his wickedness. In either case, the plan Uddhava has proposed is most favorable for the execution of the great Rājasūya sacrifice, desired by both the Lord and His pure devotees the Pāṇḍavas, headed by King Yudhiṣṭhira.\n"
