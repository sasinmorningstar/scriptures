Without consciousness, the senses are useless; indeed, the senses function through consciousness. Similarly, when the individual souls are bereft of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, love of God, they enter into a useless and illusory struggle called material existence. Pure devotees like King Yudhiṣṭhira are never bereft of the Lord's association, for they keep Him always within their heart, and yet they feel special ecstasy when they see the Lord after long separation, as described here.\n"
