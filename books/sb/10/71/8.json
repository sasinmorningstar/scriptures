The Supreme Lord, through His invisible potency of time, creates and annihilates the entire cosmic situation, whereas great demigods such as Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are merely the instruments of the Lord's will. Therefore Bhīma will have no difficulty acting as the Lord's instrument to kill the powerful Jarāsandha. In this way, by the Lord's arrangement, His devotee Bhīma will be glorified.\n"
