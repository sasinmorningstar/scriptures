The Lord further agrees that there is nothing unfair in the fact that one result is achieved by those who worship Him, and another by those who do not. The great Bhāgavatam commentators point out that by addressing King Yudhiṣṭhira as śatru-karśana, \"tormentor of enemies,\" Lord Kṛṣṇa is imparting to him the potency to conquer all the enemy kings. Thus Kṛṣṇa predicted that King Yudhiṣṭhira's noble fame would spread to all the worlds, and in fact it has.\n"
