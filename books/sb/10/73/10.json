Human life is meant to be governed by dharma, spiritual principles for gradual advancement to the perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Blinded by wealth and power, however, a foolish person does not hesitate to act whimsically, against the laws of nature and God. Unfortunately, this is now the situation in the prosperous Western countries."
