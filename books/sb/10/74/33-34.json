            "content": "The great commentator Śrīdhara Svāmī has analyzed Śiśupāla's words as follows. The term go-pāla means not only \"cowherd\" but also \"protector of the Vedas and the earth.\" Similarly, kula-pāṁsana has a double meaning. Śiśupāla intended it to mean \"the disgrace of His family,\" which is its meaning when divided as above. But the word may also be analyzed as ku-lapām aṁsana, giving a totally different meaning. Kulapām indicates those who prattle with crooked words contrary to the Vedas, and aṁsana, derived from the verb aṁsayati, means \"destroyer.\" In other words, he was praising Lord Kṛṣṇa as \"He who vanquishes all misguided and frivolous speculations about the nature of truth.\" Similarly, although Śiśupāla wanted to compare Lord Kṛṣṇa to a crow with the words yathā kākaḥ, these words may also be divided yathā a-kākaḥ. In that case, according to Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, the word kāka is a combination of ka and āka, which indicate material happiness and misery. Thus Lord Kṛṣṇa is akāka in the sense that He is beyond all material misery and happiness, being on the pure, transcendental platform. Finally, Śiśupāla was right in saying the Lord Kṛṣṇa does not deserve merely the puroḍāśa rice cake, offered to the lesser demigods as a substitute for the heavenly beverage soma. In fact, Lord Kṛṣṇa deserves to receive everything that we possess, since He is the ultimate proprietor of everything, including ourselves. Thus we should give Lord Kṛṣṇa our life and soul, not merely a ritualistic offering of rice cakes."
