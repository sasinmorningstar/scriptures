Thus to most observers it appeared that Śiśupāla achieved the impersonal liberation of merging into Lord Kṛṣṇa's bodily effulgence. In fact, after being liberated from his mortal frame, Śiśupāla returned to the side of his master, the Supreme Lord of the spiritual world. The following verse further explains this."
