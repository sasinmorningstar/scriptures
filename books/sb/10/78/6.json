Further, the word bandhu-rūpam indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa is actually everyone's true friend, and vyādhim indicates that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supersoul, the object of meditation within the heart, who takes away our mental distress. Furthermore, the ācāryas translate the word hatvā as jñātvā; in other words, by knowing Kṛṣṇa properly one can actually liberate all of one's friends.\n"
