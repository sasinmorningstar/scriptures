The estate, the possessions, the cows and calves and the subjects like the gopīs and cowherd men are all given to me.\" One should give up thinking of \"my possessions, my son and my husband\" (janasya moho'yam ahaṁ mameti (SB 5.5.8)). Nothing belongs to anyone but the Supreme Lord. Only because of illusion do we wrongly think, \"I am existing\" or \"Everything belongs to me.\" Thus mother Yaśodā completely surrendered unto the Supreme Lord. For the moment, she was rather disappointed, thinking, \"My endeavors to protect my son by charity and other auspicious activities are useless. The Supreme Lord has given me many things, but unless He takes charge of everything, there is no assurance of protection. I must therefore ultimately seek shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\" As stated by Prahlāda Mahārāja (SB 7.9.19), bālasya neha śaraṇaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha: a father and mother cannot ultimately take care of their children. Ato gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti (SB 5.5.8). One's land, home, wealth and all of one's possessions belong to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, although we wrongly think, \"I am this\" and \"These things are mine.\"\n"
