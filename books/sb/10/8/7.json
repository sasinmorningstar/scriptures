Since Kaṁsa was already searching for Kṛṣṇa, if the purificatory process were undertaken by Garga Muni, Kaṁsa might be informed, and that would create a catastrophe. It may be argued that although Garga Muni was the priest of the Yadu dynasty, Nanda Mahārāja also belonged to that dynasty. Nanda Mahārāja, however, was not acting as a kṣatriya. Therefore Garga Muni said, \"If I act as your priest, this will confirm that Kṛṣṇa is the son of Devakī.\"\n"
