The body is also the basis of the material conception of \"I,\" while one's fortune is the basis of the conception of \"mine.\" Thus by offering everything to the spiritual master, one realizes one's self to be an eternal servant of the Lord. The spiritual master does not exploit the disciple but rather engages him fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness for the disciple's eternal benefit."
