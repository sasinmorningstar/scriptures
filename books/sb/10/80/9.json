If the brāhmaṇa might say, \"How could the husband of the goddess of fortune befriend a fallen soul like myself?\" she replies by saying that Lord Kṛṣṇa is brahmaṇya, very favorably disposed toward the brāhmaṇas. If Sudāmā might claim to have no real devotion for the Lord, she replies by saying that he is a great and wise personality who would surely obtain the shelter and mercy of the Lord. If the brāhmaṇa might object that Lord Kṛṣṇa is equally disposed to all the countless unhappy conditioned souls suffering the fruits of their own karma, she replies that Lord Kṛṣṇa is especially the Lord of the devotees, and thus even if He Himself did not grant Sudāmā His mercy, certainly the devotees engaged in serving the Lord would mercifully give him some charity. Since the Lord protects the Sātvatas, the members of the Yadu dynasty, what difficulty would there be for Him to protect a humble brāhmaṇa like Sudāmā, and what fault would there be in His doing so?\n"
