According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī's further explanation of this verse, Lord Kṛṣṇa smiled at this moment, thinking \"Yes, I am going to make you show what you brought for Me.\" His smile then turned to laughter as He thought, \"How long are you going to keep this precious gift hidden in your cloth?\""
