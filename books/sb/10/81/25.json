Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī adds this insight: The night before, Sudāmā's poor, emaciated wife had been sleeping in rags under a crumbling roof, but when she woke in the morning she found herself and her house wonderfully changed. Only for a moment was she confused; she then realized that this opulence was the Lord's gift to her husband, who must be on his way home. Thus she prepared to greet him.\n"
