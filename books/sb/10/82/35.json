Following them inside were Rohiṇī, other women and men of Vraja, and a number of attendants. Inside, Nanda and Yaśodā took the two boys on their laps. Despite having heard the glories of the two Lords of Dvārakā, and despite seeing these opulences now before their eyes, Nanda and Yaśodā looked upon Them as if They were still their eight-year-old children."
