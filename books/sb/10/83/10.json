Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī mentions that while hearing Jāmbavatī's story, the women present recognized her as the girl whom Jāmbavān had once offered to Lord Śrī Rāma to be His wife. Since Lord Rāma had taken a vow to have only one wife, He could not accept her then, but did so when He returned in the Dvāpara-yuga as Kṛṣṇa. The other queens wanted to honor Jāmbavatī for this, but she replied humbly, \"I am just the Lord's maidservant.\""
