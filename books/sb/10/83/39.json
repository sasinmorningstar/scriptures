In her humility Lakṣmaṇā claimed that Kṛṣṇa's queens, unlike ordinary wives, could not bring their husband under control, and thus they could relate to Him only as servile housekeepers. In fact, however, since the Lord's queens are direct expansions of His internal pleasure potency (hlādinī-śakti), they fully controlled Him with their love."
