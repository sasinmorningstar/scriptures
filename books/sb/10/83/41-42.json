Virāṭ is explained by Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī as representing the phrase vividhaṁ virājate (\"one enjoys many kinds of opulence\") and specifically indicating the eight mystic perfections of aṇimā and so on."

They simply want the dust from Śrī Kṛṣṇa's feet, which Goddess Śrī herself worships. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī tells us that the goddess of fortune mentioned here is not Lakṣmī, the consort of Nārāyaṇa. After all, the ācārya explains, Goddess Lakṣmī could not attain the direct association of Kṛṣṇa even after performing extended austerities, as Uddhava states: nāyaṁ śrīyo 'ṅga u nitānta-rateḥ prasādaḥ (SB 10.47.60). Rather, the Śrī referred to here is the supreme goddess of fortune identified by the Bṛhad-gautamīya-tantra:"
