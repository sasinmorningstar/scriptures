This mystic process of the Lord's self-expansion is incomprehensible to all but Himself, but the example of the substance earth and its manifold products bears enough resemblance to provide some idea. The same example is also presented in an often—cited passage of the Chāndogya Upaniṣad (6.1), vācārambhaṇaṁ vikāro nāmadheyaṁ mṛttikety eva satyam: \"Earth's transformations are merely verbal creations of the process of naming; the substance earth itself is alone real.\"\n"

You simply pretend to be under higher control.\"\n"
