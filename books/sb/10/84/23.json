And those kings at Kurukṣetra who were not devotees of Kṛṣṇa could not recognize Him as time, the annihilator of everything. Devotees and nondevotees are both covered by Māyā, but in different ways. For the materialists Māyā is illusion, but for the Vaiṣṇavas she acts as Yogamāyā, the internal potency who covers their awareness of the Supreme Lord's majesty and engages them in His eternal pleasure pastimes."
