    "translation": "And on his part, Nanda was also full of affection for his friend Vasudeva. Thus during the following days Nanda would repeatedly announce, \"I will be leaving later today\" and \"I will be leaving tomorrow.\" But out of love for Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma he remained there for three more months, honored by all the Yadus.",

Thus his indecision continued for three months."
