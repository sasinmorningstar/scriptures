Let us leave now for Vraja; I cannot spend any more time here.\" Then he went to Vasudeva and told him, \"My dear friend, please send Kṛṣṇa to Vraja,\" and of King Ugrasena he requested, \"Please order my friend to do this. If you refuse, I will have to drown myself here in Lord Paraśurāma's lake. Just watch, if you do not believe me! We people of Vraja came to this holy place not to gain some piety on the occasion of the solar eclipse, but to get Kṛṣṇa back or die.\" Hearing these desperate words from Nanda, Vasudeva and the others tried to pacify him with valuable gifts."

I will do so right after we accompany Him and His relatives and friends—among them many helpless women—back to Dvārakā. Then, the very next day, without trying to obstruct Him in any way, I will let Him leave for Vraja at an auspicious time of the day. This I swear to you a thousand times over.
