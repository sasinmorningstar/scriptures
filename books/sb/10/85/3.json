Thus, of these two principles, the pradhāna is the predominated energy, female, incapable of independent action, while the puruṣa is the absolutely independent, primeval creator and enjoyer. Neither Kṛṣṇa nor His brother Balarāma belong to the category of subordinate energy; rather, both of Them together are the original puruṣa, who is always joined by His manifold potencies of pleasure, knowledge and creative emanation."
