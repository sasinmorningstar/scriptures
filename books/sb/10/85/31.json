Mahā-Viṣṇu, the first creator, is Lord Nārāyaṇa's expansion. The total material energy emanates from Mahā-Viṣṇu's glance, and of that total material energy the three modes of nature are divided portions. Thus it is Śrī Kṛṣṇa, acting through His expansions, who generates, sustains and dissolves the universe."
