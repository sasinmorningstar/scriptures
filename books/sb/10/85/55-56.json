    "translation": "\nBy drinking her nectarean milk, the remnants of what Kṛṣṇa Himself had previously drunk, the six sons touched the transcendental body of the Lord, Nārāyaṇa, and this contact awakened them to their original identities. They bowed down to Govinda, Devakī, their father and Balarāma, and then, as everyone looked on, they left for the abode of the demigods.\n\n",

First the Lord appeared before them in His four-armed Viṣṇu form, and after hearing their prayers He changed Himself into an apparently ordinary infant for their pleasure. But to save Kṛṣṇa from suffering His brothers' fate, Vasudeva at once removed Him from Kaṁsa's prison. Just before Vasudeva took Him away, mother Devakī suckled Kṛṣṇa once so that He would not feel thirsty during the long trip to Nanda-vraja. This we learn from the commentary of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura.\n"
