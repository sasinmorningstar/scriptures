And because prāṇa is so subtle—finer than the tangible manifestations of creation—it is sometimes considered the ultimate source of everything. But even subtle energies such as prāṇa depend for their functional capacity on the supremely subtle Paramātmā. That is the idea Vasudeva expresses here by the word pāratantryāt, \"because of dependence.\" Just as the velocity of an arrow is derived from the strength of the bowman who shoots it, so all subordinate energies depend on the power of the Supreme Lord.\n"
