In the opinion of Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī, King Parīkṣit's question here follows from the previous narration because Arjuna's winning the hand of Subhadrā was just as difficult a feat as Lord Kṛṣṇa's retrieving the sons of Devakī from the realm of the dead, since Lord Balarāma Himself opposed Subhadrā's marriage to Arjuna."
