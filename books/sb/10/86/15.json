Without being unnecessarily agitated for material advancement, he should devote the best part of his time and assets to his higher duties in the Supreme Lord's service. If a householder can succeed in this program despite the unavoidable difficulties of this degraded age, he can expect Lord Kṛṣṇa's personal attention, as will be seen in the case of Śrutadeva, the perfect brāhmaṇa of Mithilā."
