Śrī Kṛṣṇa was very glad to go out of His way to give them both His audience, and while leaving Dvārakā He insisted that the sages who wanted to come with Him should join Him on His chariot, because otherwise they would exhaust themselves following on foot. Renowned sages would ordinarily never even consider traveling in such an opulent conveyance, but on the Lord's order they put aside their natural aversion and joined Him on His chariot."
