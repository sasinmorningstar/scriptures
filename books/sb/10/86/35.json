The King thought, \"Since contact with the Supreme Lord can free anyone from misconceptions and doubts, Kṛṣṇa's presence in my home will fortify my intelligence so that I can withstand the onslaughts of material desires. In His expansion as Nara-Nārāyaṇa Ṛṣi, the Lord always resides in Badarikāśrama for the good of the whole land of Bharata, and so He may also create good fortune for the land of Mithilā by remaining here for at least a few days. Since Lord Kṛṣṇa's propensity is toward peace and simplicity, He will certainly prefer my simple home to the excessive opulence of Dvārakā.\"\n"
