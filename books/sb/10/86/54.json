The Supreme Personality of Godhead can be known only by means of the Vedas, and thus He relies on the brāhmaṇa sages, who are the Vedas personified, to reveal Him in this world. Even though Lord Kṛṣṇa embodies all the demigods and viṣṇu-tattva expansions of Nārāyaṇa, He considers Himself obliged to the brāhmaṇas.\n"
