Lord Śiva appears in a special liṅga form in each of these sixteen substances, which are worshiped individually as deities in various sacred locations of the universe. A devotee of Śiva may worship one of his particular liṅgas to obtain the mystic opulences pertaining to it. Thus Lord Śiva's ākāśa-liṅga bestows the opulences of ether, his jyotir-liṅga bestows the opulences of fire, and so on."
