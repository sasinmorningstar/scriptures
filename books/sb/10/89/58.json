Please quickly send these demons here to Me for the sake of their liberation.\" It is stated in Śrī Hari-vaṁśa and in the Second Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam that the path of gradual liberation passes through the intermediate station of Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu's abode, outside the eighth shell of the universe."
