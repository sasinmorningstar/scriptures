Even though I am a mere mortal, by Kṛṣṇa's mercy I have seen the Supreme Godhead, the root cause of everything.\" Then, after a moment, he thought again, \"But why did Lord Viṣṇu say that he took away the brāhmaṇa's children out of a desire to see Kṛṣṇa? Why would the Supreme Personality of Godhead hanker to see His own expansion? This might be the effect of some peculiar temporary circumstance, but since He said didṛkṣuṇā instead of didṛkṣatā—where the specific suffix -ṣuṇā carries the sense of a permanent characteristic, not a temporary one—it has to be concluded that He has always been wanting to see Kṛṣṇa and myself. Even granted that this is so, why couldn't He simply see Kṛṣṇa at Dvārakā? After all, Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu is the all-pervading creator of the universe, which He holds like an āmalaka fruit in His hand. Is it that He could not see Kṛṣṇa in Dvārakā because Kṛṣṇa does not allow anyone to see Him without His special sanction?"

He must have acted in this unusual way only because He could not give up His extreme eagerness to see Kṛṣṇa. All right, He may have acted improperly for that reason, but why couldn't He have sent a servant to kidnap the brāhmaṇa's sons? Why did He Himself have to come to Dvārakā? Was stealing them out of Lord Kṛṣṇa's capital so difficult that no one but Viṣṇu Himself could hope to accomplish it? I can understand that He intended to cause so much distress to a brāhmaṇa of Lord Kṛṣṇa's city that Kṛṣṇa would be unable to tolerate it; then He would grant Lord Viṣṇu His audience. Lord Viṣṇu inspired the distressed brāhmaṇa to pour out his complaints to Kṛṣṇa in person. Thus it is clear that Śrī Kṛṣṇa's status of Godhood is superior to Lord Mahā-Viṣṇu's.\""
