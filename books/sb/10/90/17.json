These were taken (apahṛta) by Lord Viṣṇu, and they now reside on His chest. The queens presume that the ocean is anxious to see once again the mark of Lakṣmī's residence and the Kaustubha jewel on the Lord's chest, and they express their sympathy by saying that they also want to see these marks. But the queens desire even more to see the kuṅkuma marks on the Lord's chest, which He \"took\" from their breasts when they last embraced Him."
