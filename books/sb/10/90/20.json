Your heart is distraught with great eagerness, as our hearts are, and as you remember Him again and again you shed a torrent of tears. Association with Kṛṣṇa brings such misery!\n\n",

Although the cloud shares the Lord's blue complexion, it is Lord Kṛṣṇa's distinctive features, such as His Śrīvatsa mark, that especially attract him to this meditation. But what is the result? Simply unhappiness: the cloud is depressed and thus constantly sheds tears on the pretext of raining. \"So,\" the queens advise him, \"it would be better for you not to take much interest in Kṛṣṇa.\"\n"
