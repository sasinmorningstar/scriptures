He does so by citing the interpretational rule of kapiñjalādhikaraṇa, the logic of \"referring to pigeons\": Somewhere in the Vedas is found the injunction that \"one should sacrifice some pigeons.\" This plural number should be taken to mean not an indiscriminate number of pigeons, but precisely three of them, since the Vedas never leave any matter vague. The rules of Mīmāṁsā interpretation take three as the default number when no specific number is given."
