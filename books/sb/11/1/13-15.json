Similarly, although the prākṛta-sahajiyās think of themselves as intimate associates of Kṛṣṇa, the supremely merciful Lord's determination is perfectly correct in working to finish such false devotees. Such impostors actually never accept real service to Kṛṣṇa. The yadu-kumāras' deception is termed 'seemingly humble,' meaning that in fact they were anything but humble. Therefore, the ridiculing of Vaiṣṇavas by the Lord's family resulted in a great offense against the devotees of the Lord.\"\n"
