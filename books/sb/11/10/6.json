    "synonyms": "amānī—without false ego; amatsaraḥ—not considering oneself to be the doer; dakṣaḥ—without laziness; nirmamaḥ—without any sense of proprietorship over one's wife, children, home, society, etc.; dṛḍha-sauhṛdaḥ—being fixed in the mood of loving friendship with the spiritual master, who is one's worshipable deity; asatvaraḥ—without becoming bewildered due to material passion; artha-jijñāsuḥ—desiring knowledge of the Absolute Truth; anasūyuḥ—free from envy; amogha-vāk—completely free from useless conversation.",
    "translation": "The servant or disciple of the spiritual master should be free from false prestige, never considering himself to be the doer. He should be active and never lazy and should give up all sense of proprietorship over the objects of the senses, including his wife, children, home and society. He should be endowed with feelings of loving friendship toward the spiritual master and should never become deviated or bewildered. The servant or disciple should always desire advancement in spiritual understanding, should not envy anyone and should always avoid useless conversation.",

Such material relationships appear and disappear like bubbles on the surface of the ocean. No one can claim to be the creator of the material elements that produced one's home, society and family. If it were a fact that parents were the ultimate creators of the bodies of their children, children would never die before their parents; the parents would simply create new bodies for the children. Similarly, parents would also not die, because they would create new bodies for themselves to replace the old ones. Actually, God creates everyone's bodies as well as the material elements with which we build our material societies. Therefore, before death drags these things out of our grasp, we should voluntarily engage them in the loving service of the spiritual master, who is the bona fide representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Then such material objects, instead of causing lamentation, will be the cause of happiness."
