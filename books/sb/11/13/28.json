    "synonyms": "yarhi—whereas; saṁsṛti—of material intelligence or material existence; bandhaḥ—bondage; ayam—this is; ātmanaḥ—of the soul; guṇa—in the modes of nature; vṛtti-daḥ—that which gives occupations; mayi—in Me; turye—in the fourth element (beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep); sthitaḥ—being situated; jahyāt—one should give up; tyāgaḥ—renunciation; tat—at that time; guṇa—of the material sense objects; cetasām—and of the material mind.",
    "translation": "The spirit soul is trapped in the bondage of material intelligence, which awards him constant engagement in the illusory modes of nature. But I am the fourth stage of consciousness, beyond wakefulness, dreaming and deep sleep. Becoming situated in Me, the soul should give up the bondage of material consciousness. At that time, the living entity will automatically renounce the material sense objects and the material mind.",

            "content": "Lord Kṛṣṇa now specifically answers the questions that the sages originally placed before Lord Brahmā. Ultimately, the spirit soul has nothing to do with the material sense objects and modes of nature. But because of one's false identification with the material body, the modes of nature are empowered to engage one in illusory occupations. By destroying this false identification with matter, the soul gives up the illusory occupations awarded by the modes of nature. It is clearly stated in this verse that the living entity is not empowered to independently free himself from illusion, but must situate himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in full awareness of the Supreme Lord."
