Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that the sons of Brahmā were struck with wonder at the presentation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and were thinking, \"What wonderful knowledge we have just heard.\" The Lord, recognizing their astonishment, spoke this verse to confirm their understanding of Him."
