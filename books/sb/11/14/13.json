            "content": "A devotee who is always meditating upon Lord Kṛṣṇa experiences transcendental sound, touch, form, flavor and aroma in the pastimes of the Lord. These sublime perceptions are certainly due to the causeless mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa upon one whose mind and senses are completely satisfied in Him. Such a person finds only happiness wherever he goes. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives the example that when a very wealthy man travels all over the world, at every place he stays he always enjoys the same luxurious standard of comfort. Similarly, one who has developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness is never separated from happiness, because Lord Kṛṣṇa is all-pervading. The word kiñcana indicates the so-called enjoyable things of this world. One who is akiñcana has correctly understood that material sense gratification is simply the glare of illusion, and therefore such a person is dāntasya, or self-controlled, śāntasya, or peaceful, and mayā santuṣṭa-manasaḥ, or completely satisfied with his transcendental experience of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
