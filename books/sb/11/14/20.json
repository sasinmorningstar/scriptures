Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī states, jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam: (CC Madhya 19.167) a devotee should simply depend on Kṛṣṇa and should not unnecessarily complicate his loving service with tendencies toward fruitive work or mental speculation. The residents of Vṛndāvana simply depend on Lord Kṛṣṇa. When the great serpent Aghāsura appeared in the precincts of Vraja, the cowherd boys, completely confident in their friendship with Lord Kṛṣṇa, fearlessly marched into the serpent's gigantic mouth. Such pure love for Kṛṣṇa brings the Lord under the control of the devotee.\n"
