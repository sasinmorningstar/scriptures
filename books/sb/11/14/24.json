Vilajjaḥ indicates that a devotee sometimes feels embarrassment due to bodily functions and memories of past sinful activities. In this condition, a devotee loudly cries out the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and sometimes dances in ecstasy. As stated here, such a devotee purifies the three worlds."

            "content": "By melting of the heart, one becomes very steady in spiritual life. Normally, one whose heart easily melts is thought to be unsteady; but because Lord Kṛṣṇa is the stable foundation of all existence, one whose heart melts in love of Kṛṣṇa becomes most stable and cannot be disturbed by opposing arguments, bodily suffering, mental problems, supernatural disasters or the interference of envious persons. Because such a devotee is fixed in loving service to the Lord, he becomes the very heart of the Personality of Godhead."
