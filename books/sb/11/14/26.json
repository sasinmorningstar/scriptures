    "synonyms": "yathā yathā—as much as; ātmā—the spirit soul, the conscious entity; parimṛjyate—is cleansed of material contamination; asau—he; mat-puṇya-gāthā—the pious narrations of My glories; śravaṇa—by hearing; abhidhānaiḥ—and by chanting; tathā tathā—exactly in that proportion; paśyati—he sees; vastu—the Absolute Truth; sūkṣmam—subtle, being nonmaterial; cakṣuḥ—the eye; yathā—just as; eva—certainly; añjana—with medicinal ointment; samprayuktam—treated.",
    "translation": "When a diseased eye is treated with medicinal ointment it gradually recovers its power to see. Similarly, as a conscious living entity cleanses himself of material contamination by hearing and chanting the pious narrations of My glories, he regains his ability to see Me, the Absolute Truth, in My subtle spiritual form.",

If one chants and hears the holy name and glories of Kṛṣṇa with great sincerity, there is immediately a transcendental effect. We can immediately see the spiritual world and pastimes of the Lord if we fully surrender to the process mentioned here. A blind person feels perpetual gratitude to a doctor who restores his sight. Similarly, we sing cakṣu-dāna dila ye, janme janme prabhu sei: the bona fide spiritual master, the representative of Lord Kṛṣṇa, restores our spiritual sight, and thus he is our eternal lord and master."
