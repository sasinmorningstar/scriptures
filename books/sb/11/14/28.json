    "translation": "Therefore, one should reject all material processes of elevation, which are like the mental creations of a dream, and should completely absorb one's mind in Me. By constantly thinking of Me, one becomes purified.",

One who absorbs his consciousness in Kṛṣṇa, however, attains to Kṛṣṇa's nature and is therefore described as mad-bhāva-bhāvitam, or one situated in real existence because of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord here concludes His analysis of different processes of human perfection."
