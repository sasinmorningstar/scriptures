According to one's individual way of doing things (yathā-karma) and one's personal preference (yathā-ruci), one speaks to others about what is good for them. Everyone thinks, \"What is good for me is good for everyone.\" Actually, the best thing for everyone is to surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, and thus realize one's eternal nature of bliss and knowledge. Without knowledge of the Absolute Truth, many so-called learned people are whimsically advising other whimsical people who also lack perfect knowledge of the actual goal of life."
