Thus by fixed meditation on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the soul of the mahat-tattva, one can achieve the most excellent perfection called prākāmya. Avyakta-janmanaḥ indicates that the Supreme Personality of Godhead appears from the avyakta, or the spiritual sky, or that His birth is avyakta, beyond the perception of material senses. Unless one accepts the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there is no possibility of obtaining prākāmya or any other genuine mystic perfection.\n"
