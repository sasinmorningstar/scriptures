Within the material world Lord Viṣṇu, addressed here as śvetadvīpa-pati, the Lord of Śvetadvīpa, governs the material mode of goodness and is thus called śuddha and dharma-maya, or the personification of purity and piety. By worshiping Lord Viṣṇu as the personification of material goodness one obtains the material benediction of freedom from bodily disturbance."
