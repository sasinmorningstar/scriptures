    "synonyms": "para—of another; kāyam—the body; viśan—desiring to enter; siddhaḥ—one perfected in yoga practice; ātmānam—oneself; tatra—in that body; bhāvayet—imagines; piṇḍam—one's own gross body; hitvā—giving up; viśet—one should enter; prāṇaḥ—in the subtle body; vāyu-bhūtaḥ—becoming just like the wind; ṣaṭ-aṅghri-vat—like the bee, who easily moves from one flower to another.",
    "translation": "When a perfect yogī desires to enter another's body, he should meditate upon himself within the other body, and then, giving up his own gross body, he should enter the other's body through the pathways of air, as easily as a bee leaves one flower and flies into another.",

            "content": "As air is inhaled into the body through the nostrils and mouth, similarly, the life air of the yogī's subtle body travels through the pathways of external air and easily enters into the body of another person, just as the bee easily flies from flower to flower. One may admire a heroic man or beautiful woman and desire to experience life within their extraordinary material body. Such opportunities are available through the mystic perfection called para-kāya-praveśanam. Pure devotees, being absorbed in meditation upon the spiritual form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, are not actually attracted to any material body. Thus the devotees remain transcendental and satisfied on the platform of eternal life."
