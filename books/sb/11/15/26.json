Lord Kṛṣṇa is called satya-saṅkalpa, or He whose desire, intention, purpose or resolve always comes to pass."

There are many books giving proper guidance for achieving Lord Kṛṣṇa, and the following are mentioned: Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī's Saṅkalpa-kalpavṛkṣa, Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja's Śrī Govinda-līlāmṛta, Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī's Śrī Kṛṣṇa-bhāvanāmṛta and Saṅkalpa-kalpadruma, and Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's Śrī Gaurāṅga-smaraṇa-maṅgala. In the modern age, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda has given us over sixty large volumes of transcendental literature, which can fix us firmly on the path back home, back to Godhead. Our saṅkalpa, or determination, should be practical and not useless. We should resolve to make a permanent solution to the problems of life by going back home, back to Godhead."
