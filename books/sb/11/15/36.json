Since the Lord is within everything, one might think that the Lord is divided into pieces. However, the word anāvṛta, or \"completely uncovered,\" indicates that nothing can interrupt, disturb or in any way infringe upon the supreme existence of the Absolute Truth, the Personality of Godhead. There is no actual separation between the internal and external existence of the material elements, which continuously exist everywhere. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is all-pervading and is the ultimate perfection of everything."
