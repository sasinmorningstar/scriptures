In this chapter śrī Uddhava inquires about the Lord's opulences, and here the words uccāvaceṣu bhūteṣu (\"within superior and inferior creations\") clearly refer to the Lord's external opulences, those manifested in the material world. The saintly brāhmaṇas, or Vaiṣṇavas, worship Lord Kṛṣṇa within all things and yet recognize the variety in the Lord's creation. For example, in worshiping the Deity, the devotees will select the nicest flowers, fruits and ornaments for decorating the transcendental form of the Lord. Similarly, although the Lord is present in the heart of every conditioned soul, the devotee will give more attention to a conditioned soul interested in the message of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Although the Lord is everywhere, the devotees make distinctions, for the sake of the Lord's service, between His presence in superior (ucca) and inferior (avaceṣu) creations."
