Although many great personalities are sometimes called Bhagavān, ultimately Bhagavān is the one supreme entity who possesses unlimited opulences. Throughout history, many important personalities have been addressed as \"lord,\" but ultimately there is only one Supreme Lord. In the Lord's catur-vyūha, or quadruple expansion, the first manifestation is Vāsudeva, who here represents all of the Lord's expansions in the viṣṇu-tattva category."
