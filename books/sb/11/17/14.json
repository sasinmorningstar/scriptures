The naiṣṭhiki-brahmacārī remains celibate throughout life, whereas the upakurvāṇa-brahmacārī marries upon finishing his student life. One who remains perpetually celibate is situated within the heart of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but those brahmacārīs who eventually marry are situated within the loins of the universal form of the Lord. The word vane-vāsaḥ refers to vānaprastha, or the retired order of life, which is situated on the chest of the Lord.\n"
