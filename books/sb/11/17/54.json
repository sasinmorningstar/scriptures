In this status, called mukta-saṅga, one no longer identifies oneself as a permanent resident of the material world. This liberated status may be attained even by one situated in family life. The only requirement is that one should take up a serious program of kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana, which includes constant chanting of the holy names of the Lord, worship of the Deity and participation in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Without a serious program of kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana it is very difficult to give up the iron shackles of attachment to women and the byproducts of such attachment."
