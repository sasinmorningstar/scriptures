    "translation": "\"This man taking sannyāsa is going to surpass us and go back home, back to Godhead.\" Thus thinking, the demigods create stumbling blocks on the path of the sannyāsī by appearing before him in the shape of his former wife or other women and attractive objects. But the sannyāsī should pay the demigods and their manifestations no heed.",

Lord Kṛṣṇa here encourages all sannyāsīs by telling them, \"Pay no attention to such illusory manifestations. Continue your duties and go back home, back to Godhead.\""
