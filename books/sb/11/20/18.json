One becomes gradually hopeless and despondent in material life; then, receiving good instructions from the Lord or His devotee, one transforms one's material disappointment into spiritual success. Actually, Lord Kṛṣṇa is our only true friend, and this simple understanding can bring one to a new life of spiritual happiness in the company of the Lord."
