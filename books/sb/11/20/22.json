Therefore, in the unavoidable discharge of your duty, you should not lament.\" Mano yāvat prasīdati: Until one has established one's consciousness on the liberated platform of perfect knowledge, one must constantly ward off the attacks of illusion through rigid analytic observation of material nature. The material mind may be attracted to sex; therefore by spiritual intelligence one should scrutinize the temporary nature of one's own body and the body that has artificially become the object of one's material lust. One may apply this rigid analysis to all material bodies, from the fantastic cosmic body of Lord Brahmā down to that of the most insignificant germ. As previously stated by Lord Kṛṣṇa, one who is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness spontaneously avoids sense gratification and is constantly drawn by spiritual love into his relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa. One who has not achieved the platform of spontaneous Kṛṣṇa consciousness must remain constantly vigilant so as not to be grossly cheated by the material energy of the Lord. One who tries to exploit the material energy ruins his spiritual life and experiences varieties of misery.\n"
