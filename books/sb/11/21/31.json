    "synonyms": "svapna—a dream; upamam—equal to; amum—that; lokam—world (after death); asantam—unreal; śravaṇa-priyam—only enchanting to hear about; āśiṣaḥ—mundane achievements in this life; hṛdi—in their hearts; saṅkalpya—imagining; tyajanti—they give up; arthān—their wealth; yathā—like; vaṇik—a businessman.",
    "translation": "Just as a foolish businessman gives up his real wealth in useless business speculation, foolish persons give up all that is actually valuable in life and instead pursue promotion to material heaven, which although pleasing to hear about is actually unreal, like a dream. Such bewildered persons imagine within their hearts that they will achieve all material blessings.",

As eternal living beings, part and parcel of Lord Kṛṣṇa, we are naturally endowed with all bliss and knowledge in the association of the Lord. But giving up this exalted position of spiritual bliss and knowledge, we foolishly waste our time pursuing the phantasmagoria of bodily happiness, just like a foolish businessman who squanders his real assets in imaginary business ventures that deliver no real profit."
