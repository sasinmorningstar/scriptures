In this way, the process of awakening Vedic knowledge, and thereby awakening one's eternal relationship with God, is natural and necessary for everyone. All perfection is found within the heart of the living being; as soon as the heart is purified by chanting the holy names of God, that perfection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, immediately awakens.\n"
