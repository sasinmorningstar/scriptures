The Lord therefore explains here that although not factual, material life stubbornly continues for one addicted to sense gratification, just as a frightening dream continues for one merged in sleep. The word avidyamāna, \"not existing,\" means that material life is based on mental concoction, in which one thinks, \"I am a man,\" \"I am a woman,\" \"I am a doctor,\" \"I am a senator,\" \"I am a street sweeper\" and so on. A conditioned soul enthusiastically performs his activities based on the imaginary identification with the body. Thus although the spirit soul exists and the body exists, the false identification with the body does not exist. Material life, based on a false idea, has no factual existence."

Similarly, one engaging in the devotional service of the Lord may be troubled sometimes by the dim reflection of sinful life. One should therefore become strong in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by hearing the Lord's instructions to Śrī Uddhava."
