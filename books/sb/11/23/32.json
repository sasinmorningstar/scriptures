            "content": "According to Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, the acceptance of the tridaṇḍi-sannyāsa order of life is the chief indication that one has actually taken shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The three rods of the daṇḍa, or staff, of the Vaiṣṇava sannyāsī indicate control of the body, mind and words by engaging them only in the loving service of the Lord. This procedure helps one to become more tolerant than a tree, as recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By strict control of one's body, mind and speech, the quality of tolerance becomes strengthened, and thus one manifests the further qualities of forgiving others, never wasting one's time, detachment from sense gratification, lack of false pride in one's work and not hankering for liberation. One in this way gives up the mentality of materialistic persons, who establish so-called affectionate relationships of mutual flattery and exploit each other for sense gratification. One who adopts the strict path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following in the footsteps of great souls, can achieve the shelter of the Lord."
