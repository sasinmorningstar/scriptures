    "synonyms": "na—there is not; kenacit—by the agency of anyone; kva api—anywhere; kathañcana—by any means; asya—for him, the soul; dvandva—of the duality (of happiness and distress); uparāgaḥ—the influence; parataḥ parasya—who is transcendental to material nature; yathā—in the same way as; ahamaḥ—for the false ego; saṁsṛti—to material existence; rūpiṇaḥ—which give shape; syāt—arises; evam—thus; prabuddhaḥ—one whose intelligence is awakened; na bibheti—does not fear; bhūtaiḥ—on the basis of material creation.",
    "translation": "The false ego gives shape to illusory material existence and thus experiences material happiness and distress. The spirit soul, however, is transcendental to material nature; he can never actually be affected by material happiness and distress in any place, under any circumstance or by the agency of any person. A person who understands this has nothing whatsoever to fear from the material creation.",

            "content": "The brāhmaṇa has refuted six specific explanations of the happiness and distress of the living entity, and now he refutes any other explanation that might be given. On the basis of false ego, the bodily covering factually overwhelms the spirit soul, and thus one falsely enjoys and suffers that which has no real relationship with oneself. One who can understand this sublime teaching of the brāhmaṇa, spoken by the Lord to Uddhava, will never again suffer the terrible anxiety of fear within the material world."
