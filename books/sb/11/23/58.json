    "translation": "Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: Thus becoming detached upon the loss of his property, this sage gave up his moroseness. He left home, taking sannyāsa, and began to travel about the earth. Even when insulted by foolish rascals he remained unswerved from his duty and chanted this song.",

Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura states that if one is not capable of listening to the song of this sannyāsī, then one will certainly remain an obedient servant of material illusion."
