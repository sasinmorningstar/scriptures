Lord Kṛṣṇa has elaborately described in this chapter the characteristics of the three modes of nature and the transcendental situation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has ordered us to take shelter of the holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, by which process we can easily transcend the modes of nature and begin our real life of loving devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa."
