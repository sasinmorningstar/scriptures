Within the material world the association of women is especially dangerous, and therefore in this chapter the Aila-gīta is spoken to prevent such a falldown. One can be saved from sex attraction by association with saintly persons, who awaken one's real spiritual intelligence. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa will speak to Uddhava the amazing song of Purūravā, also known as the Aila-gītā."
