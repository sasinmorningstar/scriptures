    "translation": "To hell with me! I am such a fool that I didn't even know what was good for me, although I arrogantly thought I was highly intelligent. Although I achieved the exalted position of a lord, I allowed myself to be conquered by women as if I were a bullock or a jackass.",

By the mercy of a saintly spiritual master, this lusty propensity can gradually be removed and one can understand the terrible, contemptible nature of material sense gratification. In this verse King Purūravā is coming to his senses in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
