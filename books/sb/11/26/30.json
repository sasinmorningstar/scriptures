In the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Lord Kṛṣṇa told the gopīs that they would have to accept their own service as the ultimate reward of their devotion to Him, since nothing awards as much happiness and knowledge as devotional service itself. When one sincerely chants and hears the holy name and fame of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the heart is purified ad gradually one can appreciate the actual, blissful nature of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, loving service to the Lord."
