    "translation": "My devotees bestow divine eyes, whereas the sun allows only external sight, and that only when it is risen in the sky. My devotees are one's real worshipable deities and real family; they are one's own self, and ultimately they are nondifferent from Me.",

Saintly devotees of the Lord are just like the sun. By the light of their words, the living entities' eyes of knowledge are opened and the darkness of ignorance is destroyed. Thus the saintly devotees are one's real friends and relatives. They are the proper recipients of service—not the gross material body, which merely clamors for sense gratification."
