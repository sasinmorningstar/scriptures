Members of the brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya and vaiśya communities all achieve dvijatvam, twice-born status, by initiation into the Gāyatrī mantra. Traditionally, fully qualified brāhmaṇa boys may be initiated at age eight, kṣatriyas at eleven and vaiśyas at twelve, provided the proper conditions are met. Having achieved twice-born status, one should faithfully worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His form of the Deity, as the Lord Himself will describe."
