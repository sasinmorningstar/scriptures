But at each stage—before manufacture, during manufacture, during utilization and afterward—the essential reality is gold. In the same way, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the essential reality—both the dynamic and the ingredient cause of everything. All throughout the material creation, the Lord is simply setting into motion His own potency, which is not different from Him."
