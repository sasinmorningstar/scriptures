    "translation": "For one who has properly realized My personal identity as the Supreme Godhead, what credit is there if his senses—mere products of the material modes—are perfectly concentrated in meditation? And on the other hand, what blame is incurred if his senses happen to become agitated? Indeed, what does it mean to the sun if the clouds come and go?",

Although superficially such a devotee may appear agitated by events in the material world while engaged in the Lord's mission, this does not change his exalted status as the Lord's eternal servitor, just as the exalted status of the sun is not changed even when the sun is apparently covered by clouds."
