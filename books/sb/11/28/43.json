            "content": "A devotee of the Lord keeps his body fit by eating nourishing Kṛṣṇa prasādam, by maintaining a clean and regulated life, free from unnecessary anxiety, and by chanting and dancing before the Deity of the Lord. When a devotee is sick, he accepts medical treatment by normal methods, but beyond this there is no need to absorb one's mind in the physical body in the name of so-called yoga practice. Ultimately one must accept the destiny that has been ordained by the Lord."
