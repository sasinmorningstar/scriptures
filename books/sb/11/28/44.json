In this regard Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura emphasizes that although haṭha-yogīs and rāja-yogīs try to make progress along their prescribed paths, they confront obstacles and often fail to achieve their desired goals. However, one who surrenders to the Supreme Lord will certainly be victorious on his spiritual path back home, back to Godhead."
