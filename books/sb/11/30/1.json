Because Lord Kṛṣṇa was playing the part of an ordinary member of the Yadu dynasty, He appeared to react to the curse of the brāhmaṇas by giving up His earthly pastimes. Lord Kṛṣṇa cannot actually be cursed by anyone. Nārada Muni and the other sages who cursed the Yadu dynasty are eternal devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa and could hardly curse Him. Therefore, in giving up His pastimes and leaving the earth with the Yadu dynasty, Lord Kṛṣṇa demonstrated His internal potency and personal will, since no one can challenge the supreme potency of the Personality of Godhead."
