    "translation": "Once their eyes were fixed upon His transcendental form, women were unable to withdraw them, and once that form had entered the ears of the sages and become fixed in their hearts, it would never depart. What to speak of acquiring fame, the great poets who described the beauty of the Lord's form would have their words invested with transcendentally pleasing attraction. And by seeing that form on Arjuna's chariot, all the warriors on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra attained the liberation of gaining a spiritual body similar to the Lord's.",

            "content": "Transcendental, liberated personalities such as the gopīs of Vṛndāvana and Rukmiṇī, the original goddess of fortune, were constantly meditating on the Lord's spiritual body. Great liberated sages (satām), having heard about Lord Kṛṣṇa's body, could not take it out of their hearts. The Lord's bodily beauty expanded the love and poetic output of great liberated poets, and simply by seeing Lord Kṛṣṇa's body, the warriors at Kurukṣetra achieved spiritual liberation with an eternal body similar to the Lord's. Therefore it is impossible to imagine Lord Kṛṣṇa's eternal form of bliss to be in any way material. Those who imagine that Lord Kṛṣṇa gave up His eternal form are certainly bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy."
