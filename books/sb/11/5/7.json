    "translation": "\nDue to the influence of the mode of passion, the materialistic followers of the Vedas become subject to violent desires and are excessively lusty. Their anger is like that of a snake. Deceitful, overly proud, and sinful in their behavior, they mock the devotees who are dear to Lord Acyuta.\n\n",

Such a person, filled with pride and arrogance, cannot appreciate the humble efforts of the Lord's devotees to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He thinks, \"These beggars worship Lord Viṣṇu to fill their bellies, but they will never be happy.\" Such a materialistic rascal cannot appreciate the transcendental status of the devotees of the Lord, who are personally protected and encouraged by the Personality of Godhead.\n"
