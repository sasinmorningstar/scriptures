    "synonyms": "tvattaḥ—from You; pumān—the puruṣa-avatāra, Mahā-Viṣṇu; samadhigamya—obtaining; yayā—along with which (material nature); asya—of this creation; vīryam—the potential seed; dhatte—He impregnates; mahāntam—the mahat-tattva, the raw amalgamation of matter; iva garbham—like an ordinary fetus; amogha-vīryaḥ—He whose semen is never wasted; saḥ ayam—that same (mahat-tattva); tayā—with the material nature; anugataḥ—joined; ātmanaḥ—from itself; āṇḍa-kośam—the primeval egg of the universe; haimam—golden; sasarja—produced; bahiḥ—on its outside; āvaraṇaiḥ—with several coverings; upetam—endowed.",
    "translation": "My dear Lord, the original puruṣa-avatāra, Mahā-Viṣṇu, acquires His creative potency from You. Thus with infallible energy He impregnates material nature, producing the mahat-tattva. Then the mahat-tattva, the amalgamated material energy, endowed with the potency of the Lord, produces from itself the primeval golden egg of the universe, which is covered by various layers of material elements.",

In this verse it is clearly stated that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the source of the greatest Viṣṇu incarnation, Mahā-Viṣṇu, and that Mahā-Viṣṇu acquires His creative potency from Lord Kṛṣṇa. It would therefore be foolish to surmise that Lord Kṛṣṇa is an expansion of Viṣṇu. In this regard the opinion of the demigods, headed by Brahmā, can be taken as final."
