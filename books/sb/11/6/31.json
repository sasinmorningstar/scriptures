In other words, Dvārakā, the Lord's abode, is manifest on the earth, and when the earthly Dvārakā is apparently removed, the eternal Dvārakā in the spiritual world remains as it is. Since the members of the Yadu dynasty are eternal associates of the Lord, there is no question of their destruction. Only our conditioned vision of their manifestation was destroyed. This is the meaning of the word nāśaḥ.\n"
