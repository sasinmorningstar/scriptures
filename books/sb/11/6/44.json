Ultimately, the materialist may desire religious salvation for his personal comfort and satisfaction, but all such desires are mundane, because on the spiritual platform the pure soul thinks only of the Lord's pleasure and the Lord's service. Therefore, a pure devotee can never give up Kṛṣṇa, even for a moment, although for Kṛṣṇa's pleasure he can give up the entire universe."
