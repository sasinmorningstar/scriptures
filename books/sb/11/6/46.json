As a personal, confidential associate of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Uddhava was undoubtedly a completely liberated soul. He is praying to the Lord because he cannot bear the thought of living without Kṛṣṇa even for a moment. This feeling is called love of God. Uddhava is addressing the Lord as follows: \"Even if Your illusory energy tries to attack us, my Lord, we will very easily conquer her by our powerful weapons, which are the remnants of Your foodstuffs, clothes, ornaments, and so on. In other words, we will easily conquer over māyā by kṛṣṇa-prasādam, and not by useless speculation and mental concoction.\"\n"
