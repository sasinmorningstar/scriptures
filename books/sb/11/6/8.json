    "synonyms": "tvam—You; māyayā—by the material energy; tri-guṇayā—made up of the three modes of nature; ātmani—within Yourself; durvibhāvyam—inconceivable; vyaktam—the manifest cosmos; sṛjasi—You create; avasi—protect; lumpasi—and destroy; tat—of that material nature; guṇa—within the modes (goodness, passion and ignorance); sthaḥ—situated; na—not; etaiḥ—by these; bhavān—You; ajita—O unconquerable Lord; karmabhiḥ—activities; ajyate—are entangled; vai—at all; yat—because; sve—in Your own; sukhe—happiness; avyavahite—unimpeded; abhirataḥ—You are always absorbed; anavadyaḥ—the unimpeachable Lord.",
    "translation": "O unconquerable Lord, You engage Your illusory energy, composed of three modes, to unleash, maintain and devastate the inconceivable manifest cosmos, all within Your own self. As the supreme superintendent of māyā, You appear to be situated in the interaction of the modes of nature; however, You are never affected by material activities. In fact, You are directly engaged in Your own eternal, spiritual bliss, and thus You cannot be accused of any material infection.",

The ultimate cause of the creation, maintenance and annihilation of the material world is certainly inconceivable even for the greatest mundane scientists, who waste their lives in useless and fruitless speculation. Yet Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is the secondary expansion of an expansion of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, sees the entire cosmos to be like an insignificant atom. So what hope is there for foolish so-called scientists who try to understand Kṛṣṇa by their ridiculous experimental power? Thus the word anavadya is used. No one can find fault or discrepancy in the body, character, activities or instructions of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is never materially ignorant; therefore He never exhibits cruelty, laziness, foolishness, blindness or material intoxication. Similarly, because the Lord is never polluted by material passion, He never exhibits material pride, lamentation, yearning or violence. And since the Lord is free from material goodness, He never attempts to peacefully enjoy the material world with a sublime materialistic mentality."

The Lord is being embraced and is embracing. He is joking and is hearing the joking of His loved ones. The Lord is walking through forests full of fruits and flowers, playing in the nectarean river Yamunā and taking part in His most confidential transcendental loving affairs with the cowherd girls of Vṛndāvana. These pastimes in Kṛṣṇaloka and on other Vaikuṇṭha planets are eternal, faultless and an ocean of spiritual happiness. The Lord never descends to the dry platform of relative material happiness. The infinite Personality of Godhead bas nothing to gain from anyone; thus fruitive activity cannot possibly exist within the Lord."
