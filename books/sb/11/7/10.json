The demigods, however, are never displeased with one who becomes a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa and offers all of his worship to the Lord. The demigods themselves are humble servants of Lord Kṛṣṇa, as was amply demonstrated in Lord Kṛṣṇa's pastimes on the earth. One who can experience the eternal soul within everyone's body certainly becomes dear to all living beings. Since he sees everyone as qualitatively equal to himself, he does not envy anyone nor try to lord it over any other living being. Being free from envy and a well-wisher of all, such a self-realized soul is naturally dear to everyone. As stated in the song to the six Gosvāmīs, dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pūjitau.\n"
