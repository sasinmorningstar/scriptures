            "content": "An intelligent person should understand that if there is an eternal soul different from the body, then real happiness must lie in our eternal situation, beyond the bondage of material nature. However, ordinary persons, even when discussing spiritual subject matters, generally desire to become famous or to increase their wealth and duration of life by such spiritual practices. Most common people think, for example, that the yoga system is meant for improving one's health, that one may pray to God for money, and that one's spiritual knowledge is meant for increasing one's prestige in society. Mahārāja Yadu wants to clarify that the young brāhmaṇa avadhūta is not like ordinary persons and that he is actually on a spiritual platform, as will be explained in the following verses."
