    "synonyms": "kapotau—the two pigeons; sneha—by affection; guṇita—tied together as if by ropes; hṛdayau—their hearts; gṛha-dharmiṇau—attached householders; dṛṣṭim—glance; dṛṣṭyā—by glance; aṅgam—physical body; aṅgena—by the other's body; buddhim—mind; buddhyā—by the other's mind; babandhatuḥ—they bound each other.",
    "translation": "The two pigeons were very much devoted to their household duties. Their hearts being tied together by sentimental affection, they were each attracted by the other's glances, bodily features and states of mind. Thus, they completely bound each other in affection.",

            "content": "The male and female pigeon were so attracted to each other that they could not tolerate even a moment's separation from one another. This is called bhagavad-vismṛti, or forgetfulness of the Supreme Lord and attachment to dead matter. The living entity has an eternal love for the Lord, but when perverted, that love is manifested as false material affection. A pale reflection of actual pleasure thus becomes the foundation of a false life based on forgetfulness of the Absolute Truth."
