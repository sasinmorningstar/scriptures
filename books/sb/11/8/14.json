    "synonyms": "na adhigacchet—he should not approach to enjoy; striyam—a woman; prājñaḥ—one who can intelligently discriminate; karhicit—at any time; mṛtyum—death personified; ātmanaḥ—for oneself; bala—in strength; adhikaiḥ—by those who are superior; saḥ—he; hanyeta—will be destroyed; gajaiḥ—by elephants; anyaiḥ—by others; gajaḥ—an elephant; yathā—just as.",
    "translation": "A man possessing intelligent discrimination should not under any circumstances try to exploit the beautiful form of a woman for his sense gratification. Just as an elephant trying to enjoy a she-elephant is killed by other bull elephants also enjoying her company, one trying to enjoy a lady's company can at any moment be killed by her other lovers who are stronger than he.",

Crimes of passion are extremely common. This is another disadvantage of material life."
