Mṛgī Ṛṣi thought that if his son were never exposed to the sight of women he would always remain a perfect brahmacārī. But by chance the inhabitants of the neighboring kingdom, who were suffering from a long-term drought, received divine advice that rain would return to their kingdom only after the brāhmaṇa named Ṛṣyaśṛṅga stepped foot in it. Therefore they sent beautiful women to the hermitage of Mṛgī to entice Ṛṣyaśṛṅga and bring him back with them. Since Ṛṣyaśṛṅga had never even heard about women, he easily fell for their trap.\n"

A thoughtful person should humbly take instruction from the deer, who is doomed by attraction to musical sense gratification.\n"
