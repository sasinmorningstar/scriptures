The cause of material life is one's indifference to the Absolute Truth. The conditioned soul considers himself to be the lord and enjoyer of the material world and considers the purpose of life to be sense gratification. The more one tries to enjoy the material world, the more one's illusion increases."

            "content": "It appears from this verse that the prostitute Piṅgalā was not only earning her livelihood through prostitution, but was actually enjoying her illicit contact with innumerable men. The words kāntād asataḥ indicate that she was freely selling herself without discrimination to the most ordinary and useless men, considering them to be \"lovers.\" Thus she says, \"I was a great fool.\" The word bāliśā means \"one who has a childish mentality, without practical experience of right and wrong.\""
