    "translation": "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is absolutely the most dear one for all living beings because He is everyone's well-wisher and Lord. He is the Supreme Soul situated in everyone's heart. Therefore I will now pay the price of complete surrender, and thus purchasing the Lord I will enjoy with Him just like Lakṣmīdevī.",

By following the example of Lakṣmīdevī, who always remains at the lotus feet of the Lord, one will certainly obtain eternal happiness. One should make the best use of the material body, which is a bad bargain, and surrender one's body, mind and words to the Lord. Paying such a price, one can purchase the Lord, who is everyone's dearmost well-wisher. Thus one's ancient propensity for sense gratification will automatically be controlled."
