One may question who has authorized this lady to reject even such exalted personalities as Brahmā, Śiva and the other demigods. The answer given here is that if one actually wants to solve all the problems of life and go back home, back to Godhead, then the only solution is to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is well known that the demigods themselves are subject to birth and death. As stated by Lord Śiva himself, mukti-pradātā sarveṣāṁ viṣṇur eva na saṁśayaḥ: \"There is no doubt that Viṣṇu is the deliverer of liberation for everyone.\""
