Certainly this is not a promising situation, and one who sees it loses his desire for sense gratification. Thus, by the Lord's causeless mercy, the spiritually sane living entity can protect himself from illusion."

            "content": "Since Piṅgalā is now glorifying the Personality of Godhead for His mercy in awarding salvation, the following question might arise: Is she worshiping the Lord out of love, or is she merely a salvationist desiring liberation from material existence? In answer it may be said that in her Kṛṣṇa conscious situation she is already liberated, even though remaining in this world. Her program will now be simply to render loving service to the Personality of Godhead without any personal desire, including that of salvation."
