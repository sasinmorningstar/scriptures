    "translation": "The Bhāgavatam explains how one can attain liberation at the time of death by practicing fixed meditation in yoga. It also contains a discussion between Nārada and Brahmā, an enumeration of the incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and a description of how the universe was created in progressive sequence, beginning from the unmanifest stage of material nature.",

Therefore it is understood that Sūta Gosvāmī is merely summarizing the topics. We should not consider the topics he fails to mention here less important or superfluous, since every letter and word of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is absolute, Kṛṣṇa conscious sound vibration."
