    "translation": "Even though a person's body may now have the designation \"king,\" in the end its name will be \"worms,\" \"stool\" or \"ashes.\" What can a person who injures other living beings for the sake of his body know about his own self-interest, since his activities are simply leading him to hell?",

Therefore one should not pave his way to hell by using his temporary body to injure the bodies of other living beings. In this verse the word bhūta includes nonhuman life forms, who are also creatures of God. One should give up all envious violence and learn to see God in everything by the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
