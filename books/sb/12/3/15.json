    "translation": "The person who desires pure devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa should hear the narrations of Lord Uttamaḥśloka's glorious qualities, the constant chanting of which destroys everything inauspicious.

The word nityam here indicates regulated cultivation of the topics of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and abhīkṣṇam indicates constant remembrance of such regulated spiritual experiences."
