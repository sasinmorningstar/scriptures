    "synonyms": "ghanaḥ—the cloud; yadā—when; arka-prabhavaḥ—the product of the sun; vidīryate—is torn apart; cakṣuḥ—the eye; svarūpam—in its real form; ravim—the sun; īkṣate—sees; tadā—then; yadā—when; hi—indeed also; ahaṅkāraḥ—false ego; upādhiḥ—the superficial covering; ātmanaḥ—of the spirit soul; jijñāsayā—by spiritual inquiry; naśyati—is destroyed; tarhi—at that time; anusmaret—one gains his proper remembrance.",
    "translation": "When the cloud originally produced from the sun is torn apart, the eye can see the actual form of the sun. Similarly, when the spirit soul destroys his material covering of false ego by inquiring into the transcendental science, he regains his original spiritual awareness.",

There are some creatures, however, like owls, who are averse to seeing the sun. In the same way, those who are not interested in spiritual knowledge will never receive the privilege of seeing God."
