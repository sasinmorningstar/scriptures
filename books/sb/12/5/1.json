The essence of the great ācārya's statement is that unconditional loving surrender to the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, as described by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, is the highest perfection of life. The exclusive purpose of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is to convince the conditioned soul to execute such surrender to the Lord and go back home, back to Godhead."
