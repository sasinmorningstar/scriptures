For the soul, material illusion is just like death, but Parīkṣit Mahārāja had already destroyed all those dangers that threaten one's spiritual life, such as lust, envy and fear. Śukadeva Gosvāmī here congratulates the great saintly king, who, as a pure devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa homeward bound to the spiritual sky, was far beyond the reach of death.\n"
