    "synonyms": "na bhaviṣyasi—you will not come into being; bhūtvā—becoming; tvam—you; putra—of children; pautra—grandchildren; ādi—and so on; rūpa-vān—assuming the forms; bīja—the seed; aṅkura—and the sprout; vat—like; deha-ādeḥ—from the material body and its paraphernalia; vyatiriktaḥ—distinct; yathā—as; analaḥ—the fire (from the wood).",
    "translation": "You will not take birth again in the form of your sons and grandsons, like a sprout taking birth from a seed and then generating a new seed. Rather, you are entirely distinct from the material body and its paraphernalia, in the same way that fire is distinct from its fuel.",

As stated in the śruti-mantra, pitā putreṇa pitṛmān yoni-yonau: \"A father has a father in his son, because he may take birth as his own grandson.\" The purpose of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is spiritual liberation and not the foolish prolonging of the illusion of bodily identification. That is clearly stated in this verse."
