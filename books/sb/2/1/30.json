    "synonyms": "dyauḥ—the sphere of outer space; akṣiṇī—the eyeballs; cakṣuḥ—of eyes (senses); abhūt—it so became; pataṅgaḥ—the sun; pakṣmāṇi—eyelids; viṣṇoḥ—of the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Viṣṇu; ahanī—day and night; ubhe—both; ca—and; tat—His; bhrū—eyebrows; vijṛmbhaḥ—movements; parameṣṭhi—the supreme entity (Brahmā); dhiṣṇyam—post; āpaḥ—Varuṇa, the director of water; asya—His; tālū—palate; rasaḥ—juice; eva—certainly; jihvā—the tongue.",
    "translation": "The sphere of outer space constitutes His eyepits, and the eyeball is the sun as the power of seeing. His eyelids are both the day and night, and in the movements of His eyebrows, the Brahmā and similar supreme personalities reside. His palate is the director of water, Varuṇa, and the juice or essence of everything is His tongue.",

            "content": "To common sense the description in this verse appears to be somewhat contradictory because sometimes the sun has been described as the eyeball and sometimes as the outer space sphere. But there is no room for common sense in the injunctions of the śāstras. We must accept the description of the śāstras and concentrate more on the form of the virāṭ-rūpa than on common sense. Common sense is always imperfect, whereas the description in the śāstras is always perfect and complete. If there is any incongruity, it is due to our imperfection and not the śāstras'. That is the method of approaching Vedic wisdom."
