    "translation": "The material manifestation's ultimate particle, which is indivisible and not formed into a body, is called the atom.

In modern science also, the atom is accepted as the ultimate indivisible particle of which the universe is composed. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam is the full text of all descriptions of knowledge, including the theory of atomism. The atom is the minute subtle form of eternal time."
