In Bhagavad-gītā (BG 1.40) it is said, \"When there is deliberate negligence of the regulative principles of religious life, the women as a class become polluted, and as a result there are unwanted children.\" This is especially true for boys; if the mother is not good, there cannot be good sons. The learned Kaśyapa could foresee the character of the sons who would be born of the condemned womb of Diti. The womb was condemned because of the mother's being too sexually inclined and thus transgressing all the laws and injunctions of the scriptures. In a society where such women are predominant, one should not expect good children.\n"
