The first is to give protection to persons who take shelter of His lotus feet, and the second is to give trouble to those who are always demoniac and who are inimical toward the Lord. Māyā's function is to give afflictions to the nondevotees. Here Brahmā said, \"You are the protector of the surrendered souls; therefore I surrender unto Your lotus feet. Please give me protection from these demons.\"\n"
