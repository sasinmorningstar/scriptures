People used to go to places of pilgrimage and give munificently in charity. This system is still current. Therefore the Lord said, \"In order to sanctify your activities and the results of your actions, you will offer everything unto Me.\" This is also confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā: \"Whatever you do, whatever you eat, whatever you sacrifice, the result should be given to Me only.\" In another place in Bhagavad-gītā the Lord said, \"I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices, all penances and everything done for the welfare of mankind or society.\" All activities, therefore, whether for the welfare of family, society, country or humanity at large, must be performed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the instruction given by the Lord to Kardama Muni. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira welcomed Nārada Muni: \"Wherever you are present, that place becomes sanctified because the Lord Himself is always seated in your heart.\" Similarly, if we act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness under the direction of the Lord and His representative, then everything is sanctified. This is the indication given to Kardama Muni, who acted on it and therefore received the most excellent wife and child, as will be disclosed in later verses.\n"
