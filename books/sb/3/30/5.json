            "content": "It is said that once Indra, the King of heaven, was cursed by his spiritual master, Bṛhaspati, on account of his misbehavior, and he became a hog on this planet. After many days, when Brahmā wanted to recall him to his heavenly kingdom, Indra, in the form of a hog, forgot everything of his royal position in the heavenly kingdom, and he refused to go back. This is the spell of māyā. Even Indra forgets his heavenly standard of life and is satisfied with the standard of a hog's life. By the influence of māyā the conditioned soul becomes so affectionate towards his particular type of body that if he is offered, \"Give up this body, and immediately you will have a king's body,\" he will not agree. This attachment strongly affects all conditioned living entities. Lord Kṛṣṇa is personally canvassing, \"Give up everything in this material world. Come to Me, and I shall give you all protection,\" but we are not agreeable. We think, \"We are quite all right. Why should we surrender unto Kṛṣṇa and go back to His kingdom?\" This is called illusion, or māyā. Everyone is satisfied with his standard of living, however abominable it may be."
