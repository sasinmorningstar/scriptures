The higher planets like the moon and Venus have time measurements different from those of the earth. It is said that six months of this planet earth equal one day of the higher planets. In Bhagavad-gītā the duration of one day in Brahmaloka is measured to be 1,000 times the four yugas, or 4,300,000 years multiplied by 1,000. And the month and year in Brahmaloka are calculated in that measure.\n"
