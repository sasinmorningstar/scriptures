But even though liberated, he was, for the time being, afflicted by the illusion of māyā, thinking himself the brother of Uttama in the bodily concept of life. The whole material world is working on the basis of \"I\" and \"mine.\" This is the root of attraction to the material world. If one is attracted by this root of illusory conceptions—\"I\" and \"mine\"—he will have to remain within this material world in different exalted or nasty positions. By the grace of Lord Kṛṣṇa, the sages and Lord Manu reminded Dhruva Mahārāja that he should not continue this material conception of \"I\" and \"mine.\" Simply by devotional service unto the Lord his illusion could be eradicated without difficulty."
