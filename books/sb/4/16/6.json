Tax revenues should be distributed to the citizens in times of need, during emergencies such as famine or flood. Tax revenues should never be distributed amongst governmental servants in the form of high salaries and various other allowances. In Kali-yuga, however, the position of the citizens is very horrible because taxes are exacted in so many forms and are spent for the personal comforts of the administrators.\n"

The sun is many millions of miles away from the earth, and although the sun does not actually touch the earth, it manages to distribute clouds all over the planet by exacting water from the oceans and seas, and in due course of time the clouds pour water on the earth during the rainy season. As an ideal king, King Pṛthu would execute all this business in the village and state as expertly as the sun.\n"
