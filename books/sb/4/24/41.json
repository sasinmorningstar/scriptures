According to Bhagavad-gītā (BG 16.7), pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ: the asuras do not know which way one should be inclined to act and which way one should not be inclined to act. Although the asuras oppose devotional service, it is to be understood that they are inclined that way due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because the asuras do not like to engage in the Lord's devotional service, the Lord within gives them the intelligence to forget. Ordinary karmīs desire promotion to Pitṛloka, as confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 9.25). Yānti deva-vratā devān pitṟn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ: \"Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods, and those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors.\"\n"
