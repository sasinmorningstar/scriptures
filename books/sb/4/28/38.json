Actually, however, Parabrahman, the Supreme Brahman, is Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva. As stated in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 7.19), vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti: Vāsudeva extends everywhere as the impersonal Brahman. One cannot fix one's mind upon an impersonal \"something.\" Bhagavad-gītā (BG 12.5) therefore says, kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām: \"For those whose minds are attached to the unmanifested, impersonal feature of the Supreme, advancement is very troublesome.\" Consequently, when it is said herein that King Malayadhvaja fixed his mind on Brahman, \"Brahman\" means the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva.\n"
