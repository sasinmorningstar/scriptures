The word gata-vyathāḥ, used in this connection, means \"without fear.\" Satī did not care that she was going alone; therefore she was almost fearless. The word anucarāḥ is also significant, for it indicates that Lord Śiva's disciples were always ready to sacrifice anything for Lord Śiva. All of them could understand the desire of Śiva, who did not want Satī to go alone. Anucarāḥ means \"those who can immediately understand the purpose of their master.\"\n"
