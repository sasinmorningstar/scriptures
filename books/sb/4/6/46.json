    "synonyms": "na—not; vai—but; satām—of the devotees; tvat-caraṇa-arpita-ātmanām—of those who are completely surrendered at your lotus feet; bhūteṣu—among living entities; sarveṣu—all varieties; abhipaśyatām—perfectly seeing; tava—your; bhūtāni—living entities; ca—and; ātmani—in the Supreme; apṛthak—nondifferent; didṛkṣatām—those who see like that; prāyeṇa—almost always; roṣaḥ—anger; abhibhavet—takes place; yathā—exactly like; paśum—the animals.",
    "translation": "My dear Lord, devotees who have fully dedicated their lives unto your lotus feet certainly observe your presence as Paramātmā in each and every being, and as such they do not differentiate between one living being and another. Such persons treat all living entities equally. They never become overwhelmed by anger like animals, who can see nothing without differentiation.",

Therefore pure devotees do not make any distinction between the Lord's anger and His blessings. They see both with reference to the Lord's behavior with others and themselves. A devotee does not find fault with the behavior of the Lord in any circumstances."
