    "synonyms": "yasmin—in some place; yadā—when; puṣkara-nābha-māyayā—by the illusory energy of Puṣkaranābha, the Supreme Personality of Godhead; durantayā—insurmountable; spṛṣṭa-dhiyaḥ—bewildered; pṛthak-dṛśaḥ—the same persons who see differently; kurvanti—do; tatra—there; hi—certainly; anukampayā—out of compassion; kṛpām—mercy; na—never; sādhavaḥ—saintly persons; daiva-balāt—by providence; kṛte—being done; kramam—prowess.",
    "translation": "My dear lord, if in some places materialists, who are already bewildered by the insurmountable illusory energy of the Supreme Godhead, sometimes commit offenses, a saintly person, with compassion, does not take this seriously. Knowing that they commit offenses because they are overpowered by the illusory energy, he does not show his prowess to counteract them.",

            "content": "It is said that the beauty of a tapasvī, or saintly person, is forgiveness. There are many instances in the spiritual history of the world in which many saintly persons, although unnecessarily harassed, did not take action, although they could have done so. Parīkṣit Mahārāja, for example, was unnecessarily cursed by a brāhmaṇa boy, and this was very much regretted by the boy's father, but Parīkṣit Mahārāja accepted the curse and agreed to die within a week as the brāhmaṇa boy desired. Parīkṣit Mahārāja was the emperor and was full in power both spiritually and materially, but out of compassion and out of respect for the brāhmaṇa community, he did not counteract the action of the brāhmaṇa boy but agreed to die within seven days. Because it was desired by Kṛṣṇa that Parīkṣit Mahārāja agree to the punishment so that the instruction of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam would thus be revealed to the world, Parīkṣit Mahārāja was advised not to take action. A Vaiṣṇava is personally tolerant for the benefit of others. When he does not show his prowess, this does not mean that he is lacking in strength; rather, it indicates that he is tolerant for the welfare of the entire human society."
