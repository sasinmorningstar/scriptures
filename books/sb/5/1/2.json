The Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be understood by any means except bhakti. The Lord confirms this in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (SB 11.14.21). Bhaktyāham ekayā grāhyaḥ: \"only by executing devotional service can one appreciate Me.\" Similarly, in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 18.55) Lord Kṛṣṇa says, bhaktyā mām abhijānāti: \"simply by discharging devotional service, one can understand Me.\" Thus for a bhakta to become attached to family affairs is impossible, since a bhakta and his associates are liberated. Everyone is searching after ānanda, or bliss, but in the material world there can never be any bliss. It is only possible in devotional service. Attachment for family affairs and devotional service are incompatible. Therefore Mahārāja Parīkṣit was somewhat surprised to hear that Mahārāja Priyavrata was simultaneously attached to devotional service and to family life.\n"
