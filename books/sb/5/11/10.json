    "translation": "\nSound, touch, form, taste and smell are the objects of the five knowledge-acquiring senses. Speech, touch, movement, evacuation and sexual intercourse are the objects of the working senses. Besides this, there is another conception by which one thinks, \"This is my body, this is my society, this is my family, this is my nation,\" and so forth. This eleventh function, that of the mind, is called the false ego. According to some philosophers, this is the twelfth function, and its field of activity is the body.\n\n",

When the false ego expands, it makes one think. \"This is my body, family, society, country,\" etc.\n"
