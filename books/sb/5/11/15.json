These are all called upādhis, designations, and one has to become freed from them (sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam (CC Madhya 19.170)). As long as one is not freed, he has to continue conditioned life in material existence. The human form of life is meant for cleansing away these misconceptions. If this is not done, one has to repeat the cycle of birth and death and thus suffer all material conditions.\n"
