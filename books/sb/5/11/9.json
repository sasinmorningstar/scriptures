In all cases, the mind is the controller or owner. By the false ego one thinks oneself the body and thinks in terms of \"my body, my house, my family, my society, my nation\" and so on. These false identifications are due to the expansions of the false ego. Thus one thinks that he is this or that. Thus the living entity becomes entangled in material existence.\n"
