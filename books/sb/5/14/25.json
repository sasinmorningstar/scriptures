    "synonyms": "kvacit—sometimes; ca—also; śīta-vāta-ādi—such as cold and strong wind; aneka—various; adhidaivika—created by the demigods; bhautika—adhibhautika, created by other living beings; ātmīyānām—adhyātmika, created by the body and mind; daśānām—of conditions of misery; pratinivāraṇe—in the counteracting; akalpaḥ—unable; duranta—very severe; cintayā—by anxieties; viṣaṇṇaḥ—morose; āste—he remains.",
    "translation": "Being unable to protect himself from the threefold miseries of material existence, the conditioned soul becomes very morose and lives a life of lamentation. These threefold miseries are miseries suffered by mental calamity at the hands of the demigods [such as freezing wind and scorching heat], miseries offered by other living entities, and miseries arising from the mind and body themselves.",

Actually no one can counteract these threefold miseries. All three may assail one at one time, or one misery may be absent and the other present. Thus the living entity is full of anxiety, fearing misery from one side or the other. The conditioned soul must be disturbed by at least one of these three miseries. There is no escape."
