            "content": "Now Āgnīdhra frankly admits his weakness. He was attracted to Pūrvacitti, and therefore before she could say, \"But I have no business with you,\" he expressed his desire to be united with her. He was so attracted that he was ready to go anywhere, hell or heaven, in her company. When one is absorbed in lust and the influence of sex, one surrenders to the feet of a woman without reservations. Śrīla Madhvācārya remarks in this connection that when one engages in joking and talking like a crazy person, one may say anything and everything, but his words will be meaningless."
