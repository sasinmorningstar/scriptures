    "synonyms": "yasya—of whom; ha vāva—indeed; kṣuta—when in hunger; patana—falling down; praskhalana-ādiṣu—stumbling and so on; vivaśaḥ—being helpless; sakṛt—once; nāma abhigṛṇan—chanting the holy name of the Lord; puruṣaḥ—a person; karma-bandhanam—the bondage of fruitive activity; añjasā—completely; vidhunoti—washes away; yasya—of which; ha—certainly; eva—in this way; pratibādhanam—the repulsion; mumukṣavaḥ—persons desiring liberation; anyathā—otherwise; eva—certainly; upalabhante—are trying to realize.",
    "translation": "If one who is embarrassed by hunger or who falls down or stumbles chants the holy name of the Lord even once, willingly or unwillingly, he is immediately freed from the reactions of his past deeds. Karmīs entangled in material activities face many difficulties in the practice of mystic yoga and other endeavors to achieve that same freedom.",

A devotee automatically attains liberation without separate endeavors. Bali Mahārāja did not get back all his material possessions merely because of his charity to the Lord. One who becomes a devotee, free from material desires and motives, regards all opportunities, both material and spiritual, as benedictions from the Lord, and in this way his service to the Lord is never hampered. Bhukti, material enjoyment, and mukti, liberation, are only by-products of devotional service. A devotee need not work separately to attain mukti. Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura said, muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate 'smān: a pure devotee of the Lord does not have to endeavor separately for mukti, because mukti is always ready to serve him."
