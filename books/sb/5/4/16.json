The brāhmaṇas would give advice according to the śāstras, and all the other castes would follow. The word brahma means \"perfect knowledge of all activities,\" and this knowledge is very confidentially described in the Vedic literatures. Men trained perfectly as brāhmaṇas should know all Vedic literature, and the benefit derived from this literature should be distributed to the general populace. The general populace should follow the perfect brāhmaṇa. In this way, one can learn how to control the mind and senses and thus gradually advance to spiritual perfection.\n"
