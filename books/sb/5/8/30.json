    "synonyms": "iti—thus; evam—in this way; nigūḍha—hidden; nirvedaḥ—completely unattached to material activities; visṛjya—giving up; mṛgīm—the deer; mātaram—its mother; punaḥ—again; bhagavat-kṣetram—the place where the Supreme Lord is worshiped; upaśama-śīla—completely detached from all material attachments; muni-gaṇa-dayitam—which is dear to the great saintly residents; śālagrāmam—the village known as Śālagrāma; pulastya-pulaha-āśramam—to the āśrama conducted by such great sages as Pulastya and Pulaha; kālañjarāt—from the Kālañjara Mountain, where he had taken his birth in the womb of a deer; pratyājagāma—he came back.",
    "translation": "Although Bharata Mahārāja received the body of a deer, by constant repentance he became completely detached from all material things. He did not disclose these things to anyone, but he left his mother deer in a place known as Kālañjara Mountain, where he was born. He again went to the forest of Śālagrāma and to the āśrama of Pulastya and Pulaha.",

            "content": "It is significant that Mahārāja Bharata, by the grace of Vāsudeva, remembered his past life. He did not waste a moment; he returned to Pulaha-āśrama to the village known as Śālagrāma. Association is very meaningful; therefore ISKCON tries to perfect one who enters the society. The members of this society should always remember that the society is not like a free hotel. All the members should be very careful to execute their spiritual duties so that whoever comes will automatically become a devotee and will be able to return back to Godhead in this very life. Although Bharata Mahārāja acquired the body of a deer, he again left his hearth and home, in this case the Mountain Kālañjara. No one should be captivated by his birthplace and family; one should take shelter of the association of devotees and cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness."
