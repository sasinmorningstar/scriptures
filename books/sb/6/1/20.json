Actually, the descriptions of the Purāṇas, or the old histories of the universe, are factual, although not chronological.

One should not foolishly consider the Purāṇas mythological. If they were mythological, Śukadeva Gosvāmī would not have taken the trouble to recite the old historical incidents concerning the life of Ajāmila. Now the history begins as follows."
