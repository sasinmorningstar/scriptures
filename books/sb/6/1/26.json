Always engaged in taking care of the child and calling his name, Nārāyaṇa, Ajāmila could not understand that his own time was now exhausted and that death was upon him.\n\n",

Although this man completely forgot Nārāyaṇa, he was calling his child, saying, \"Nārāyaṇa, please come eat this food. Nārāyaṇa, please come drink this milk.\" Somehow or other, therefore, he was attached to the name Nārāyaṇa. This is called ajñāta-sukṛti. Although calling for his son, he was unknowingly chanting the name of Nārāyaṇa, and the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so transcendentally powerful that his chanting was being counted and recorded.\n"
