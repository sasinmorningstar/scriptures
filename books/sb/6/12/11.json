These energies cannot create anything independently. This is also confirmed by the Lord Himself in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 9.10): mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram. \"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving living beings.\" Only under the direction of the Lord, the Supreme Person, can prakṛti, which is manifested in twenty-four elements, create different situations for the living entity. In the Vedas the Lord says:"

Therefore everyone should hear from Me about My glorious activities.\" The Lord also says in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 10.2), aham ādir hi devānām: \"I am the origin of all the demigods.\" Therefore the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin of everything, and no one is independent of Him. Śrīla Madhvācārya also says, anīśa jīva-rūpeṇa: the living entity is anīśa, never the controller, but is always controlled. Therefore when a living entity becomes proud of being an independent īśvara, or god, that is his foolishness. Such foolishness is described in the following verse."
