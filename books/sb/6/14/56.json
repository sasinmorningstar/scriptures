Unless one has a son to offer oblations to the pitās, or forefathers, one must suffer in Yamarāja's kingdom. King Citraketu was very much aggrieved. thinking that because his son was going away with Yamarāja he himself would again suffer. The subtle laws exist for the karmīs; if one becomes a devotee, he has no more obligations to the laws of karma.\n"
