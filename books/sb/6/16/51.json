Then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is within the core of everyone's heart, speaks to the devotee (dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te). Citraketu Mahārāja was first instructed by his gurus, Aṅgirā and Nārada, and now, having followed their instructions, he has come to the stage of seeing the Supreme Lord face to face.

In His eternal, blissful form, Lord Kṛṣṇa is accepted by Arjuna as paraṁ brahma. A living entity in the conditioned stage accepts something illusory as substantial. This is called māyā or avidyā—ignorance. Therefore according to the Vedic knowledge, one must become a devotee, and one must then distinguish between avidyā and vidyā, which are elaborately explained in the Īśopaniṣad. When one is actually on the platform of vidyā, he can personally understand the Personality of Godhead in His forms like those of Lord Rāma, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Saṅkarṣaṇa. The Vedic knowledge is described as the breathing of the Supreme Lord, and activities begin on the basis of Vedic knowledge. Therefore the Lord says that when He endeavors or breathes, the material universes come into existence, and various activities gradually develop. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gītā, praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu: \"I am the syllable oṁ in all the Vedic mantras.\" Vedic knowledge begins with the vibration of the transcendental sound praṇava, oṁkāra. The same transcendental sound is Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ: (CC Madhya 17.133) there is no difference between the holy name of the Lord and the Lord Himself.\n"
