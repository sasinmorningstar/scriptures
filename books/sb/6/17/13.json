    "translation": "This Citraketu is the lowest of kṣatriyas, for he has impudently overridden Brahmā and the other demigods by insulting Lord Śiva, upon whose lotus feet they always meditate. Lord Śiva is personified religion and the spiritual master of the entire world, and therefore Citraketu must be punished.",

Citraketu nonetheless criticized Lord Śiva, and therefore the opinion of Pārvatī was that he should be punished."
