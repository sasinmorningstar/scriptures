    "synonyms": "yaḥ—anyone who; etam—this; paramam—very; guhyam—confidential; itihāsam—historical narration; agha-apaham—which frees one from all reactions to sins; śṛṇuyāt—hears; śraddhayā—with faith; yuktaḥ—endowed; yaḥ—one who; ca—also; bhaktyā—with great devotion; anukīrtayet—repeats; na—not; vai—indeed; saḥ—such a person; narakam—to hell; yāti—goes; na—not; īkṣitaḥ—is observed; yama-kiṅkaraiḥ—by the order carriers of Yamarāja; yadi api—although; amaṅgalaḥ—inauspicious; martyaḥ—a living entity with a material body; viṣṇu-loke—in the spiritual world; mahīyate—is welcomed and respectfully received.",
    "translation": "Because this very confidential historical narration has the potency to vanquish all sinful reactions, one who hears or describes it with faith and devotion is no longer doomed to hellish life, regardless of his having a material body and regardless of how sinful he may have been. Indeed, the Yamadūtas, who carry out the orders of Yamarāja, do not approach him even to see him. After giving up his body, he returns home, back to Godhead, where he is very respectfully received and worshiped.",
