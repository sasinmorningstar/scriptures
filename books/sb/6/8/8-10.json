    "translation": "\nOne must then chant the mantra of six syllables [oṁ viṣṇave namaḥ]. One should place the syllable \"oṁ\" on his heart, the syllable \"vi\" on the top of his head, the syllable \"ṣa\" between his eyebrows, the syllable \"ṇa\" on his tuft of hair [śikhā], and the syllable \"ve\" between his eyes. The chanter of the mantra should then place the syllable \"na\" on all the joints of his body and meditate on the syllable \"ma\" as being a weapon. He should thus become the perfect personification of the mantra. Thereafter, adding visarga to the final syllable \"ma,\" he should chant the mantra \"maḥ astrāya phaṭ\" in all directions, beginning from the east. In this way, all directions will be bound by the protective armor of the mantra.\n\n",
