He is the pratyak, or antaryāmī, of all living entities. The Lord says in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 13.3), kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata: \"O scion of Bharata, you should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies.\" Because the Lord is the Supersoul, He is the active principle of every living entity and even the atom (aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham). He is the actual reality. According to various stages of intelligence, one realizes the presence of the Supreme in everything through the manifestations of His energy. The entire world is permeated by the three guṇas, and one can understand His presence according to one's modes of material nature.\n"
