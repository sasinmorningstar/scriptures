This sāyujya-mukti is impossible to attain even for great transcendentalists. How then did the enemy of the Lord attain it?\n\n",

Śiśupāla, however, was neither a jñānī nor a bhakta, yet simply by envy of the Lord he attained an exalted position by merging into the Lord's body. Certainly this was astonishing, and therefore Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira inquired about the cause for the Lord's mysterious mercy to Śiśupāla.\n"
