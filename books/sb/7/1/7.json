There is no question of His being influenced by sattva-guṇa, rujo-guṇa or tamo-guṇa, for these material qualities cannot touch the Supreme Lord. The Lord is therefore called the supreme īśvara. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ: (BS 5.1) He is the supreme controller. He controls the material qualities (daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā (BG 7.14)). Mayādhyakṣena prakṛtiḥ sūyate: (BG 9.10) material nature (prakṛti) works under His order. How, then, can He be under the qualities of prakṛti? Kṛṣṇa is never influenced by the material qualities. Therefore there is no question of partiality in the Supreme Personality of Godhead."
