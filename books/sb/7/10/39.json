    "synonyms": "enaḥ—this sinful activity (of blaspheming the Supreme Lord); pūrva-kṛtam—executed in previous births; yat—which; tat—that; rājānaḥ—kings; kṛṣṇa-vairiṇaḥ—always acting as enemies of Kṛṣṇa; jahuḥ—gave up; te—all of them; ante—at the time of death; tat-ātmānaḥ—attaining the same spiritual body and form; kīṭaḥ—a worm; peśaskṛtaḥ—(captured by) a black drone; yathā—just like.",
    "translation": "Not only Śiśupāla and Dantavakra but also many, many other kings who acted as enemies of Kṛṣṇa attained salvation at the time of death. Because they thought of the Lord, they received spiritual bodies and forms the same as His, just as worms captured by a black drone obtain the same type of body as the drone.",

            "content": "The mystery of yogic meditation is explained here. Real yogīs always meditate on the form of Viṣṇu within their hearts. Consequently, at the time of death they give up their bodies while thinking of the form of Viṣṇu and thus attain Viṣṇuloka, Vaikuṇṭhaloka, where they receive bodily features the same as those of the Lord. From the Sixth Canto we have already learned that when the Viṣṇudūtas came from Vaikuṇṭha to deliver Ajāmila, they looked exactly like Viṣṇu, with four hands and the same features as Viṣṇu. Therefore, we may conclude that if one practices thinking of Viṣṇu and is fully absorbed in thinking of Him at the time of death, one returns home, back to Godhead. Even enemies of Kṛṣṇa who thought of Kṛṣṇa in fear (bhaya), such as King Kaṁsa, received bodies in a spiritual identity similar to that of the Lord."
