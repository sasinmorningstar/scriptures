Maya Dānava said, \"However I plan, you plan or both of us plan, the Lord has planned what is to happen. No one's plan will be successful without His sanction.\" We may make our own various plans, but unless they are sanctioned by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, they will never be successful. Hundreds and millions of plans are made by all kinds of living entities, but without the sanction of the Supreme Lord they are futile."
