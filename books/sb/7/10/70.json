    "synonyms": "evam vidhāni—in this way; asya—of Kṛṣṇa; hareḥ—of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; sva-māyayā—by His transcendental potencies; viḍambamānasya—acting like an ordinary human being; nṛ-lokam—within human society; ātmanaḥ—of Him; vīryāṇi—transcendental activities; gītāni—narrations; ṛṣibhiḥ—by great saintly persons; jagat-guroḥ—of the supreme master; lokam—all the planetary systems; punānāni—purifying; aparam—what else; vadāmi kim—can I say.",
    "translation": "The Lord, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, appeared as a human being, yet He performed many uncommon and wonderful pastimes by His own potency. How can I say more about His activities than what has already been said by great saintly persons? Everyone can be purified by His activities, simply by hearing about them from the right source.",

            "content": "Bhagavad-gītā and all the Vedic literatures fully explain that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, appears in human society as an ordinary human being but acts very uncommonly for the well-being of the entire world. One should not be influenced by the illusory energy and think Lord Kṛṣṇa to be an ordinary human being. Those who really seek the Absolute Truth come to the understanding that Kṛṣṇa is everything (vāsudevaḥ samam iti). Such great souls are very rare. Nonetheless, if one studies the entire Bhagavad-gītā as it is, Kṛṣṇa is very easy to understand. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just trying to make Kṛṣṇa known all over the world as the Supreme Personality of Godhead (kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam (SB 1.3.28)). If people take this movement seriously, their lives as human beings will be successful."
