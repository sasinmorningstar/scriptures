As stated in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 9.25), yānti deva-vratā devān: one who worships the demigods can be promoted to their planets. Yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām: and if one practices devotional service to the Lord, he goes back home, back to Godhead. In the human form of life, therefore, one is meant to act auspiciously in order to return home, back to Godhead. Devotional service, however, does not depend on material conditions. Ahaituky apratihatā. Of course, for those who are engaged in fruitive activities on the material platform, the times and seasons mentioned above are extremely congenial.\n"
