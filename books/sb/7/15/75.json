            "content": "Here is a statement exalting a Vaiṣṇava. In human society, a brāhmaṇa is the most respected person. A brāhmaṇa is one who can understand Brahman, the impersonal Brahman, but hardly ever can one understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is described by Arjuna in Bhagavad-gītā as paraṁ brahma. A brāhmaṇa may be extremely fortunate in having achieved brahma jñāna, but the Pāṇḍavas were so exalted that the Parabrahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, was living in their house like an ordinary human being. The word bhūri-bhāgāḥ indicates that the Pāṇḍavas were in a still higher position than brahmacārīs and brāhmaṇas. In the following verses, Nārada Muni repeatedly glorifies the position of the Pāṇḍavas."
