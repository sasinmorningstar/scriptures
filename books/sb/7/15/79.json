Asaṁśayaṁ samagram. Without any doubt and without any defect, one should understand Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead and thus surrender at His lotus feet. Ordinary persons do not do this, even after hearing all the Vedas, but if one is fortunate, although it may be even after many, many births, he comes to this conclusion (bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate (BG 7.19))."
