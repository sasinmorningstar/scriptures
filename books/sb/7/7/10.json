The Lord promises in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 9.31), kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati. This is a declaration by the Supreme Personality of Godhead that His devotee cannot be killed by demons. Prahlāda Mahārāja is the vivid example of the truth of this promise. Nārada Muni told the King of heaven, \"it would be impossible for you to kill the child, even though you are demigods, and certainly it would be impossible for others.\"\n"
