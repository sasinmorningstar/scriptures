    "translation": "When a devotee becomes like a person haunted by a ghost, he laughs and very loudly chants about the qualities of the Lord. Sometimes he sits to perform meditation, and he offers respects to every living entity, considering him a devotee of the Lord. Constantly breathing very heavily, he becomes careless of social etiquette and loudly chants like a madman, \"Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa! O my Lord, O master of the universe!\"",
