She is carried by her lion carrier, or the modes of passion and ignorance.

This is an extremely difficult task. As the Lord says in Bhagavad-gītā (BG 7.14), daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā: \"This divine energy of Mine, consisting of the three modes of material nature, is difficult to overcome.\" The same word duratyaya, meaning \"very difficult,\" is used here. Therefore one cannot surpass the stringent laws of material nature except by the mercy of the Supreme Lord. Nonetheless, although all materialists are baffled in their plans, they try again and again to become happy in this material world. Therefore they have been described as vimūḍha—first-class fools. As for Prahlāda Mahārāja, he was not at all unhappy, for although he was in the material world, he was full of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, trying to serve the Lord, are not unhappy, whereas one who has no assets in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and is struggling for existence is not only foolish but extremely unhappy also. Prahlāda Mahārāja was happy and unhappy simultaneously. He felt happiness and transcendental bliss because of his being Kṛṣṇa conscious, yet he felt great unhappiness for the fools and rascals who make elaborate plans to be happy in this material world.\n"
