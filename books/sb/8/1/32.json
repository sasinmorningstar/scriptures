We have published many books, including Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta in seventeen volumes, four hundred pages each, as well as Bhagavad-gītā and The Nectar of Devotion. We are also publishing Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in sixty volumes. Wherever a speaker holds discourses from these books and an audience hears him, this will create a good and auspicious situation. Therefore the preaching of Kṛṣṇa consciousness must be done very carefully by the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, especially the sannyāsīs. This will create an auspicious atmosphere."
