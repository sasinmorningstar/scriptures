This success is explained here. Rāddham indra-padaṁ hitvā tataḥ siddhim avāpsyati. Siddhi consists of achieving the favor of Lord Viṣṇu, not the yoga-siddhis. The yoga-siddhis-aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, prākāmya, īśitva, vaśitva and kāmāvasāyitā—are temporary. The ultimate siddhi is to achieve the favor of Lord Viṣṇu."
