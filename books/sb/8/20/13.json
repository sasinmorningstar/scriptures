    "translation": "If this brāhmaṇa really is Lord Viṣṇu, who is worshiped by Vedic hymns, He would never give up His widespread reputation; either He would lie down having been killed by me, or He would kill me in a fight.",

Lord Viṣṇu can kill everyone, but He cannot be killed. Thus the real meaning of the words \"lie down\" is that Lord Viṣṇu would reside within the core of Bali Mahārāja's heart. Lord Viṣṇu is defeated by a devotee through devotional service; otherwise, no one can defeat Lord Viṣṇu."
