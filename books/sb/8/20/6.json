    "translation": "My lord, you can also see that all the material opulences of this world are certainly separated from their possessor at death. Therefore, if the brāhmaṇa Vāmanadeva is not satisfied by whatever gifts one has given, why not please Him with the riches one is destined to lose at death?",

Bali Mahārāja, as a pure devotee, had already decided to give all the land to Lord Viṣṇu."
