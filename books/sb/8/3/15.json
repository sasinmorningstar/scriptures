I offer my respectful obeisances unto You, who are the shelter of the Vedic knowledge contained in the śāstras like the Pañcarātras and Vedānta-sūtra, which are Your representations, and who are the source of the paramparā system. Because it is You who can give liberation, You are the only shelter for all transcendentalists. Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto You.\n\n",

He is wonderful in the sense that although there may be unlimited emanations from the Supreme Personality of Godhead (janmādy asya yataḥ (SB 1.1.1)), He always remains complete (pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate (Śrī Īśopaniṣad, Invocation)). In our experience in the material world, if we have a bank balance of one million dollars, as we withdraw money from the bank the balance gradually diminishes until it becomes nil. However, the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is so complete that although innumerable Personalities of Godhead expand from Him, He remains the same Supreme Personality of Godhead. Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate. Therefore He is the wonderful cause. Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.\n"

Therefore anyone who desires anything—whether he be a karmī, a jñānī or a yogī—should try to perceive the Supreme Personality of Godhead very seriously, and all of his desires will be fulfilled. The Lord says, ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham: (BG 4.11) \"As the living entities surrender unto Me, I reward them accordingly.\" Even the karmī who wants everything for his enjoyment can get it from Kṛṣṇa.
