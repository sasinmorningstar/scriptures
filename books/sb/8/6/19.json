Kālena means \"favored by time,\" and kāvyena means \"favored by Śukrācārya,\" Śukrācārya being the spiritual master of the Daityas. The demons and Daityas were favored in both ways, and therefore the demigods were advised by the Supreme Lord to execute a truce for the time being, until time favored them."
