There are many instances of this in the history of Vedic literature. Whenever we find a description of ideal chaste women, mother Sītā is among them. Mandodarī, the wife of Rāvaṇa, was also very chaste. Similarly, Draupadī was one of five exalted chaste women. As a man must follow great personalities like Brahmā and Nārada, a woman must follow the path of such ideal women as Sītā, Mandodarī and Draupadī. By staying chaste and faithful to her husband, a woman enriches herself with supernatural power. It is a moral principle that one should not be influenced by lusty desires for another's wife. Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu: an intelligent person must look upon another's wife as being like his mother. This is a moral injunction from Cāṇakya-śloka (10).\n"

Because she was a chaste woman, she knew the power of another chaste woman, especially such a wife as mother Sītādevī.\n"
