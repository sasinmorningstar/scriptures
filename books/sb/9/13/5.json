    "translation": "For unnecessarily cursing him when he had committed no offense, Mahārāja Nimi countercursed his spiritual master. \"For the sake of getting contributions from the King of heaven,\" he said, \"you have lost your religious intelligence.

In this case, however, for the sake of more lucrative remunerations from the King of heaven, Vasiṣṭha neglected Mahārāja Nimi's request on this planet, and when Nimi performed the sacrifices with other priests, Vasiṣṭha unnecessarily cursed him. When one is infected by contaminated activities, his power, material or spiritual, reduces. Although Vasiṣṭha was the spiritual master of Mahārāja Nimi, because of his greed he became fallen."
