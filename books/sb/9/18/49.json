Such a great soul is very rare.\" The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva, is one with the Supreme Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Everything is in Him in the beginning, and at the end all manifestations enter into Him. He is situated in everyone's heart (sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ (BG 15.15)). And from Him everything has emanated (janmādy asya yataḥ (SB 1.1.1)). All material manifestations, however, are temporary. The word svapna means \"dreams,\" māyā means \"illusion,\" and manoratha means \"mental creations.\" Dreams, illusions and mental creations are temporary. Similarly, all material creation is temporary, but Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the eternal Absolute Truth."
