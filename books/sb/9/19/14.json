    "translation": "As supplying butter to a fire does not diminish the fire but instead increases it more and more, the endeavor to stop lusty desires by continual enjoyment can never be successful. [In fact, one must voluntarily cease from material desires.]",

The example given here is very appropriate. One cannot stop a blazing fire by trying to extinguish it with butter."
