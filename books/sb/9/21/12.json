    "synonyms": "na—not; kāmaye—desire; aham—I; gatim—destination; īśvarāt—from the Supreme Personality of Godhead; parām—great; aṣṭa-ṛddhi-yuktām—composed of the eight kinds of mystic perfection; apunaḥ-bhavam—cessation of repeated birth (liberation, salvation); vā—either; ārtim—sufferings; prapadye—I accept; akhila-deha-bhājām—of all living entities; antaḥ-sthitaḥ—staying among them; yena—by which; bhavanti—they become; aduḥkhāḥ—without distress.",
    "translation": "I do not pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead for the eight perfections of mystic yoga, nor for salvation from repeated birth and death. I want only to stay among all the living entities and suffer all distresses on their behalf, so that they may be freed from suffering.",

Vāsudeva Datta submitted that if they were unfit to be liberated, he himself would take all their sinful reactions and suffer personally so that the Lord might deliver them. A Vaiṣṇava is therefore described as being para-duḥkha-duḥkhī, very much aggrieved by the sufferings of others. As such, a Vaiṣṇava engages in activities for the real welfare of human society."
