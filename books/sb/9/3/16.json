    "translation": "The chaste and very beautiful Sukanyā could not distinguish her husband from the two Aśvinī-kumāras, for they were equally beautiful. Not understanding who her real husband was, she took shelter of the Aśvinī-kumāras.",

A chaste woman will never accept any man other than her husband, even if there be someone equally as handsome and qualified."
