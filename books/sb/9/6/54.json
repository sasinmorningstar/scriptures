This is confirmed in Bhagavad-gītā (tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti (BG 4.9)). If one is free from the bondage of both the gross and subtle material bodies and remains a pure soul, he returns home, back to Godhead, to be engaged in the service of the Lord. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti: he goes back home, back to Godhead. Thus it appears that Saubhari Muni attained that perfect stage.\n"
